SUBJECT: Application for Scrum Master at Kforce Technology Staffing
CONTENT: 
Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my keen interest in the Scrum Master position I discovered on LinkedIn. With over 10 years of progressive experience leading agile teams and a strong background in the hospitality sector, I am confident that my skills as a coach, facilitator, and leader align perfectly with the requirements of this role and the needs of your client.

<br><br>

In a previous role at Globant, I served as a Technical Project Manager and Scrum Master for Royal Caribbean Group. The challenge was to enhance the digital guest experience across several key onboard applications. I led multiple globally distributed agile teams, implementing SAFe and Scrum methodologies to drive the development of new features for the Guest App and Digital Concierge. By facilitating PI Planning, coaching teams on agile principles, and ensuring transparent communication, we successfully launched high-value features that significantly improved the guest journey and increased ancillary revenue.

<br><br>

I have consistently focused on fostering collaboration and continuous improvement to elevate team performance. For example, while working with a major retail client, the team faced challenges with predictability and delivery speed. I implemented a robust framework of KPIs and OKRs, refined backlog management processes, and coached the teams through Scrum ceremonies to remove impediments and improve velocity. This adaptive approach resulted in a 40% improvement in the e-commerce platform's performance and ensured consistent, on-time delivery of quarterly roadmaps.

<br><br>

The opportunity to apply my expertise within the Hotel Management or Vacation Ownership industry is particularly exciting. My direct experience in enhancing guest-facing technology in a large-scale hospitality environment has prepared me to deliver immediate value. I am passionate about leveraging agile practices to build exceptional products that define a first-class customer experience, and I am eager to bring my dedication and skills to your team.

<br><br>

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing how I can contribute to your client's success.
