CONTENT: Dear Hiring Manager,<br><br>I am writing to express my keen interest in the Client Coding Project Manager position at Datavant, as advertised on LinkedIn. With over 10 years of project management experience, particularly in leading remote teams and implementing robust quality assurance programs within regulated industries like healthcare, I am confident I possess the skills to excel in this role.<br><br>In my previous roles, I have consistently been tasked with ensuring operational excellence and compliance. For instance, at Mango-Soft, I managed a project to integrate hospital imaging (DICOM) and patient data (HL7 V2) systems. I led the team through the complex technical and compliance requirements, established a hypercare support plan, and delivered a solution that significantly improved data accessibility for healthcare providers. This experience demonstrates my ability to manage projects centered on sensitive data and complex standards.<br><br>Furthermore, I have a strong record of enhancing process quality and team performance.

By implementing a new QA framework and an adaptive quarterly roadmap, my team improved the Core Web Vitals by 40%. I also have extensive experience overseeing large-scale remote operations, having led globally distributed teams of over 100 engineers, establishing the communication, reporting, and quality control structures necessary for success.<br><br>Datavant's mission to power healthcare decisions with the right data deeply resonates with my professional passion for leveraging technology to solve complex problems. My background in managing projects with a focus on quality, compliance, and process improvement, combined with my experience in the healthcare technology space, aligns perfectly with the requirements of this role.
