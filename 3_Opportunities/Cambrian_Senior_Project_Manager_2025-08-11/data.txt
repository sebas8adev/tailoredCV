SUBJECT: Application for Senior Project Manager at Cambrian
CONTENT: 
Dear Cassandra Coleman,
<br><br>
I am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in the Senior Project Manager position at Cambrian, which I discovered on LinkedIn. Your focus on leading transformative projects and driving meaningful impact resonates deeply with my professional experience and career goals.
<br><br>
In my role at Globant, a key client, Royal Caribbean, faced the problem of needing to innovate their digital guest experience to increase onboard revenue. As the lead Project Manager, my action was to direct three globally distributed teams (15+ members) through the full project lifecycle, implementing an AI-powered chatbot and other digital concierge services. The result was a significant enhancement in guest services, a streamlined user journey, and the creation of new revenue streams through tailored onboard advertising.
<br><br>
Similarly, when Dick's Sporting Goods was challenged by a slow e-commerce platform that hurt sales, I led a 30+ person program to tackle the issue. My team and I re-architected front-end components and optimized the platform based on Core Web Vitals. This action resulted in a 40% improvement in site performance, directly boosting user engagement and supporting a better online shopping experience.
<br><br>
Your team's passion for delivering results in a collaborative, innovative environment is exactly the kind of culture where I thrive. I am confident that my adaptive leadership style and extensive experience managing complex, high-impact technology projects would allow me to contribute significantly to Cambrian's vision. I am eager to discuss how my skills can help you achieve your next transformative goals.
