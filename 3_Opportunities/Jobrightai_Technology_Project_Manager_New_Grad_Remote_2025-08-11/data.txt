SUBJECT: Application for Technology Project Manager at GeneDx
CONTENT: <p>I am writing to express my keen interest in the Technology Project Manager position at GeneDx, as advertised on LinkedIn.  GeneDx's commitment to leveraging AI and machine learning in genetic testing to transform medical practice deeply resonates with my passion for applying technology to improve healthcare outcomes. My 10+ years of experience leading complex projects across diverse industries, including healthcare, align perfectly with the requirements of this role.</p>

<p>In my previous role at Mango-Soft, I faced the challenge of implementing a voice-to-text system for healthcare professionals, integrating various medical devices with cloud services (AWS). I successfully addressed this by leading the project team through requirements gathering, vendor selection and contract negotiation, development, and deployment, resulting in on-time and within-budget delivery, enhancing patient care and operational efficiency. </p>

<p>At Globant, I managed a program of projects encompassing mobile app development, ecommerce platforms, and data warehouse initiatives for clients such as Royal Caribbean and Dick's Sporting Goods, consistently delivering projects on time and under budget. My adaptive approach to project management ensured successful outcomes even when faced with evolving business requirements and technological challenges. My focus on vendor management, risk mitigation, and  meticulous reporting consistently exceeded stakeholder expectations.</p>

<p>My experience includes managing 100+ person teams, defining key performance indicators, and implementing robust monitoring processes.  I am confident in my ability to seamlessly coordinate cross-platform engineering initiatives, manage vendor relationships, and contribute significantly to the operational excellence of GeneDx's engineering operations.  My certifications in SAFe and Scrum, along with my Google Cloud Digital Leader certification, further solidify my qualifications for this role.</p>
