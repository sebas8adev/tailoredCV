# Cover Letter Content
SUBJECT: Application for Program Manager, People Strategy & Enablement at Confluent
CONTENT: Dear Alexandra Amico,<br><br>I am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in the Program Manager, People Strategy & Enablement role at Confluent. Your position as a leader in real-time data streaming creates a dynamic, high-growth environment where operational excellence within the People function is critical. My background in driving large-scale strategic initiatives and enabling organizational effectiveness is directly aligned with the needs of this role.<br><br>In a previous role, a key challenge was managing rapid organizational growth without standardized processes, leading to inconsistencies in project delivery and team performance. I addressed this by designing and implementing a Scrum of Scrums framework for over 100 professionals at Banco de Chile. I coached five Scrum Masters, established unified KPI/OKR reporting, and scaled best practices across the program. This action served as a strategic transformation, improving operational efficiency and ensuring all teams were aligned with executive goals.<br><br>Furthermore, I have direct experience with people processes and systems. Faced with the need to quickly build multiple high-performance teams, I led the end-to-end staffing program for over 150 technical and project roles. I translated business needs into clear job requirements, managed the hiring pipeline, and coordinated the selection process, effectively acting as the operational lead for this critical HR function. This resulted in a streamlined talent acquisition process, reducing time-to-fill and building the skilled teams necessary to drive project success.<br><br>My experience in strategic planning, cross-functional project leadership, and performance metrics has prepared me to be the "operational glue" for your People team. I am eager to discuss how I can contribute to Confluent's continued success by enabling its most valuable asset: its people.
