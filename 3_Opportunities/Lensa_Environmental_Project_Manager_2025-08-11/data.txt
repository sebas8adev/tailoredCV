SUBJECT: Application for Environmental Project Manager at APTIM
CONTENT: 
Dear Hiring Manager,
<br>
<br>
I am writing to express my keen interest in the Environmental Project Manager position at APTIM, as advertised on LinkedIn. While my professional background is rooted in technology and digital transformation, I am deeply motivated by APTIM's mission to build a sustainable future and am confident that my extensive project management expertise is directly transferable to the challenges and responsibilities of this role.
<br>
<br>
For example, a significant challenge in my previous roles involved managing large-scale, complex projects for diverse stakeholders, including government entities and private corporations, with stringent budget and compliance requirements. At Globant, I was tasked with leading a portfolio of projects for clients like Banco de Chile. I directed a cross-functional team of over 100 professionals to execute a complex datacenter migration and datawarehouse implementation. This involved meticulous planning, financial oversight of budgets exceeding $1M, and navigating a highly regulated banking environment. My actions resulted in the successful, on-time delivery of the program, meeting all compliance and security mandates while fulfilling key business objectives for the client.
<br>
<br>
I am eager to apply my adaptive and rigorous project management discipline—honed over 20 years of leading teams and delivering results—to advance APTIM’s impactful work. The opportunity to contribute my skills in proposal development, lifecycle management, and client relations to projects that create a cleaner, more resilient world is incredibly compelling.
<br>
<br>
Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing how my experience in managing complex projects and leading high-performing teams can benefit APTIM.
