SUBJECT: Application for Senior Project Manager (Google Cloud Platform) at Curate Partners
CONTENT: 
Dear Hiring Manager,
<br><br>
I am writing to express my keen interest in the Senior Project Manager (Google Cloud Platform) role. My background is centered on leading high-impact, technically complex projects, which aligns perfectly with the requirements of this position.
<br><br>
Your client requires a senior leader to manage key Google Cloud Platform (GCP) initiatives, including compute and Composer migrations, while overseeing budgets and improving engineering workflows. In my role at Globant, I directly addressed a similar challenge by leading the large-scale data center migration from on-premise infrastructure to GCP for Banco de Chile. I was responsible for the entire project lifecycle, including the data warehouse and data lake components, which directly relates to your need for experience with data pipelines. I successfully managed project constraints, including a multi-million dollar budget, and directed a distributed team of over 100 engineers across eight countries, delivering the project on schedule and achieving all defined KPIs.
<br><br>
I am passionate about leveraging cloud technologies to drive business transformation and operational excellence. The opportunity to apply my expertise in GCP, FinOps, and workflow systematization to support your client's key initiatives is highly compelling. I am confident in my ability to drive cross-functional alignment and deliver significant value.
<br><br>
Thank you for your time and consideration. I have attached my resume for your review and welcome the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further.
