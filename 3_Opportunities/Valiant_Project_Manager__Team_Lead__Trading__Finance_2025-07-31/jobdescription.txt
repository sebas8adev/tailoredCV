About the job
About Us:

We're a performance-focused growth marketing agency serving trading firms, prop trading companies, and financial service providers. At the core of our philosophy is the belief that excellence stems from a united team working toward a common objective: to help our clients grow profitably while providing an experience they can't find anywhere else.

We're aggressive about results and hold ourselves to exceptionally high standards. Our clients trust us with their growth because we deliver. This is a high-growth environment where things move fast, priorities shift, and we need people who thrive in high-stakes environments while maintaining exceptional quality standards.


About the Role:

üí∏ Salary: $52,000 - $72,000 (based on experience), with earnings potential up to $106,000 in the first 12 months via performance milestones directly tied to the retention of the clients within your pod.
üåé Location: Fully remote (English-first countries only).
üöÄ High-Growth Environment: Join a fast-growing company with a proven sales engine‚Äîthis is a rare opportunity to be part of a team that‚Äôs built for scale.
‚úàÔ∏è Perks: Quarterly Miami team meet-ups, Employer 401k's, and Free Access to dozens of trading tools and finance communities

We need a Project Manager / Team Lead who will be the orchestrator of high-performance marketing delivery across multiple trading and financial services accounts. You'll lead a team of 10 team members, optimize resource allocation, and ensure seamless execution across our trading & finance client initiatives.

This isn't a director-level strategic role ‚Äî it's for someone who embodies extreme ownership, loves being in the trenches, and directly impacts client results through hands-on leadership. You'll be a key backbone within our service delivery operation, and will be leading our iGaming marketing pod.


What You'll Own:

‚Äî Manage day-to-day project management for 20 iGaming/sports betting client accounts across multiple marketing channels.
‚Äî Lead and keep accountable a team of 10 specialists across creative, copy, organic, paid, email, and funnel development.
‚Äî Review and allocate workload strategically to ensure optimal team performance and exceptional client delivery.
‚Äî Being proactive, making sure to check in on deliverables and timelines. Always filling in the gaps. Not allowing anything to slip through cracks and ensuring we're always on top of everything.
‚Äî Collaborate with our senior leadership to improve & build processes that scale in a fast-paced, high-stakes environment. This includes going out of your way to come up with ways to make things run smoother.
‚Äî Hold yourself and your team accountable to extremely high-standards. Simply doing the marketing in a presentable way is not good enough. Clients expect Valiant as the leader within the trading industry, to go above and beyond what they'd come to expect from past marketing agencies.
‚Äî Facilitate seamless coordination between account managers, service team members, and clients.
‚Äî Track and analyze performance metrics to identify optimization opportunities
‚Äî Experiment with emerging marketing & project management tools and platforms as the sports betting and marketing industries evolve.
‚Äî Keep things organized and own quality assurance ‚Äî broken links, typos, and mediocre strategies are client-ending mistakes.
‚Äî Take full responsibility for your team's output, growth, and development.


Who We're Looking For:

‚Äî Experience in project management ‚Äî you've had past experience managing teams and projects in a marketing agency or other services based company. You have a track record of successfully managing projects and small teams in demanding client environments. 
‚Äî Marketing experience ‚Äî you've personally had experience with launching or directly overseeing social media campaigns, email automation sequences, paid ads, or building website funnels. 
‚Äî Tech-savvy with genuine interest in software and products ‚Äî you leverage technology for efficiency and understand the tools that drive results
‚Äî Utterly obsessed with excellence ‚Äî this isn't a job, it's a mission. Fire and tenacity are in your DNA
‚Äî Extreme ownership mentality ‚Äî you think like an owner, not an employee, and take full responsibility for outcomes
‚Äî Relentless urgency and hardcore attitude ‚Äî you operate with relentless urgency and inspire others to match your pace. You're driven and highly motivated, and are not the type to want to clock off early or be opposed to never working a weekend when duty calls. 
‚Äî Self-directed operator and a Natural leader ‚Äî you seek context through smart questions but execute without hand-holding. You set the standard and your team follows because they believe in your vision. You're a natural leader. 


You'll Excel Here If You:

‚Äî Have real aggression and force to drive things forward ‚Äî "a little obsessed" is an understatement
‚Äî Fight for clients and hold everyone (including yourself) to the highest standards
‚Äî Make quick, confident decisions based on the right inputs ‚Äî analysis paralysis isn't in your vocabulary
‚Äî Run daily operations with military precision while maintaining team morale
‚Äî Get your hands dirty ‚Äî no task is beneath you if it drives results
‚Äî Balance uncompromising standards with strategic flexibility
‚Äî Can navigate client objections and regulatory compliance issues with confidence
‚Äî Understand that exceptional trading marketing requires all channels working in perfect harmony
‚Äî Know the difference between retail trader and institutional client acquisition strategies


Nice-to-haves:

‚Äî Entrepreneur background ‚Äî you've built something from scratch and know the grind
‚Äî Marketing agency experience ‚Äî you understand the unique challenges of agency life
‚Äî Prop firm or trading industry knowledge ‚Äî you speak the language and navigate the culture naturally. Even better, you understand trader acquisition costs, account funding rates, and what drives conversions in this trust-dependent industry
‚Äî Understanding of challenge-based marketing and trader evaluation processes
‚Äî Experience building high-performing teams in financial services environments


What Success Looks Like:

‚Äî In 30 days: You've taken complete ownership of team operations, gained full context on all clients and our 10-person Finance marketing pod, and become the reliable backbone that AMs and team members depend on.
‚Äî In 60 days: Workflows are optimized, your team is exceeding benchmarks, and clients are actively noticing the elevated performance in trader acquisition and account funding.
‚Äî In 90 days: You've built scalable systems that deliver consistent excellence, and your team is operating at a level that sets new agency standards.


Reality Check:

This role demands someone who thrives under extreme pressure without compromising quality. You'll be orchestrating marketing for trading firms who measure success by one metric: revenue generated. "Good enough" doesn't exist here ‚Äî excellence is the baseline expectation.


This position requires:

‚Äî Working nights, weekends, and holidays when the business demands it
‚Äî Making tough calls that prioritize results over comfort
‚Äî Fighting battles (internal and external) to protect quality and standards
‚Äî Pushing your team to levels they didn't know they could reach
‚Äî Taking complete ownership when things go wrong ‚Äî no excuses, only solutions

If you're looking for work-life balance, predictable days, or clearly defined processes, this isn't for you. But if you're obsessed with building something extraordinary in the trading industry, if you have the fire to forge a world-class team through chaos, and if you're driven by an insatiable hunger to dominate this market ‚Äî let's talk.

How to Apply:

Please submit a 3-5 minute Loom video along with your application to: natanel.rozic@valiant.biz. In your video, please cover the following:

Keep it intense and authentic - we want to see your fire, your ability to handle extreme pressure, and your natural leadership presence. Show us you're not just qualified, but that you're the type of person who thrives in chaotic, high-performance environments and makes everyone around you better through sheer force of will.
