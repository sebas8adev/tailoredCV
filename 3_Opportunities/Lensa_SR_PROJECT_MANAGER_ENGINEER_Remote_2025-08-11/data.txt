SUBJECT: Application for SR PROJECT MANAGER ENGINEER at TE Connectivity
CONTENT: 
Dear Hiring Manager,
<br>
I am writing to express my keen interest in the SR PROJECT MANAGER ENGINEER position at TE Connectivity, as advertised on LinkedIn. My extensive background in leading end-to-end development for complex hardware and industrial products, combined with a passion for creating a more connected world, aligns perfectly with TE's mission and the requirements of this role.
<br>
In my career, I have consistently confronted the challenge of delivering sophisticated technology products within stringent budget, time, and quality constraints across global markets. At TIPI, I addressed this by directing the entire product lifecycle for a bodycam system for law enforcement. My action was to lead a cross-functional team through a Stage-Gate process, managing everything from hardware firmware development and manufacturing coordination to the deployment of a SaaS management platform. The result was the successful on-time, on-budget deployment of over 3,000 units, meeting rigorous government contract specifications and enhancing public safety operations.
<br>
Similarly, my experience includes managing project financials and performing economic analysis to ensure viability and control costs. I have successfully managed capital and expense budgets for multiple high-complexity projects, consistently meeting financial metrics and delivering positive ROI. My adaptive approach to project management, blending Agile and traditional methodologies, has been instrumental in navigating complex stakeholder environments and resolving impediments swiftly.
<br>
I am confident that my 10+ years of experience in project management, particularly within the hardware and industrial product domains, and my ability to lead distributed, multicultural teams to success make me an ideal candidate for this role. I am eager to bring my results-driven mindset and technical leadership to TE Connectivity.
