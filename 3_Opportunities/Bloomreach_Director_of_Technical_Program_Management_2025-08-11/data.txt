SUBJECT: Application for Director of Technical Program Management at Bloomreach
CONTENT: 
Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in the Director of Technical Program Management position at Bloomreach, as advertised on LinkedIn. Your mission to revolutionize business-to-customer connections with an agentic AI platform is precisely the kind of forward-thinking, high-impact environment where I thrive. With over 10 years of experience leading complex B2B SaaS programs and building high-performing TPM teams, I am confident I possess the leadership and strategic execution skills to help scale your TPM function and drive your product initiatives forward.
<br><br>
In high-growth environments, a key challenge is maintaining momentum across complex, cross-functional programs. At Globant, I was tasked with orchestrating large-scale initiatives for clients like Royal Caribbean and Dick's Sporting Goods. I took action by implementing and leading adaptive Agile frameworks (SAFe, Scrum of Scrums) to align global teams of over 100 engineers, product managers, and stakeholders. The result was a 40% improvement in e-commerce platform performance and the successful, on-time delivery of multiple AI-driven features, directly enhancing the customer experience and driving business value.
<br><br>
A core responsibility of this role is to define and scale the TPM function. In a previous engagement with Banco de Chile, I faced the challenge of structuring program delivery for a rapidly growing portfolio. I designed and institutionalized a Scrum of Scrums model, where I hired, mentored, and led a team of five scrum masters. By establishing clear OKR/KPI reporting mechanisms for executive visibility, I created a scalable, data-driven delivery framework that consistently met quarterly business objectives and fostered a culture of ownership and continuous improvement.
<br><br>
I am passionate about not just executing programs, but building the systems and teams that enable programmatic excellence. My background in delivering AI-powered solutions, managing platform-spanning dependencies, and fostering strong partnerships with executive leadership aligns directly with the requirements of this role and Bloomreachâ€™s goals. I am eager to bring my experience to your team, contribute to the evolution of the Loomi AI engine, and help shape the future of your TPM organization.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing how my experience can contribute to Bloomreach's success.
