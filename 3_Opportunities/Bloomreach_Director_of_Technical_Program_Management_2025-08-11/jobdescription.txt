About the job
Bloomreach is building the world’s premier agentic platform for personalization.We’re revolutionizing how businesses connect with their customers, building and deploying AI agents to personalize the entire customer journey.

We're taking autonomous search mainstream, making product discovery more intuitive and conversational for customers, and more profitable for businesses.
We’re making conversational shopping a reality, connecting every shopper with tailored guidance and product expertise — available on demand, at every touchpoint in their journey.
We're designing the future of autonomous marketing, taking the work out of workflows, and reclaiming the creative, strategic, and customer-first work marketers were always meant to do.


And we're building all of that on the intelligence of a single AI engine — Loomi AI — so that personalization isn't only autonomous…it's also consistent.From retail to financial services, hospitality to gaming, businesses use Bloomreach to drive higher growth and lasting loyalty. We power personalization for more than 1,400 global brands, including American Eagle, Sonepar, and Pandora.

As Director of Technical Program Management, you will lead the planning and execution of major product initiatives across Bloomreach’s Engagement and Discovery platforms. You’ll drive cross-functional alignment between product, engineering, and go-to-market teams—ensuring timely, high-quality releases that support our business priorities.

In this role, you’ll operationalize product delivery by building scalable workflows, streamlining processes, and developing reporting mechanisms that enhance visibility and accountability. You’ll also serve as a key liaison to Revenue, Marketing, and Customer Success teams to ensure organizational readiness and successful product adoption.

To succeed, you’ll need to lead a global team, influence across functions, and bring clarity and momentum to complex initiatives—all while operating in a fast-moving, agile environment. This is a high-impact leadership role for someone who can drive execution at scale while helping shape the future of the TPM function at Bloomreach.

Your responsibilities will include:

Define and Scale the TPM Function: Shape and evolve the charter for the Technical Program Management function at Bloomreach, aligning it with the company’s strategic objectives and product development needs.
Drive Cross-Functional Alignment: Lead the initiation of complex programs by aligning stakeholders on vision, business outcomes, and scope. Establish clear program structures, milestones, and governance processes to ensure successful execution.
Own Program Delivery: Act as the central driver for strategic initiatives—removing blockers, resolving cross-functional issues, and ensuring timely delivery of business-critical outcomes. Be the connective tissue across Product, Engineering, and Go-to-Market teams.
Lead Agile Delivery at Scale: Partner closely with Product and Engineering leadership to guide teams through the full software delivery lifecycle, applying Agile best practices to drive velocity, quality, and iterative progress.
Partner with Executive Leadership: Build strong, trust-based relationships with functional heads and executive stakeholders. Serve as a thought partner to help drive prioritization, resource alignment, and transparency across initiatives.
Build and Develop a High-Performing Team: Hire, mentor, and scale a team of Program Managers. Foster a culture of ownership, continuous improvement, and impact-driven execution. Support individual growth and career development.
Enable Programmatic Excellence: Coach your team in defining program success metrics, establishing execution plans, and managing risk and dependencies proactively. Raise the bar on program delivery standards across the organization.
Engage Globally: Travel periodically to our global product development hubs (U.S., Europe, India) to strengthen cross-site alignment, conduct in-person workshops, and reinforce a globally consistent execution culture.
 Influence and Inspire: Operate as a strategic leader across the product and technology organization. Contribute to org-wide planning, challenge the status quo, and help shape the future of our platform and operating model.
