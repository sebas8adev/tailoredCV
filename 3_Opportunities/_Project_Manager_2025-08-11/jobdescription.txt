Job Description:
About the job
Hi there 
I'm Destiny, the founder of HarmonyHaus—a one-of-a-kind, multi-phase creative and wellness hub designed with accessibility, innovation, and community at its core.
I’m looking for a resourceful, strategic, and heart-driven project coordinator to walk with me during the early operational phase of building this vision. This is a volunteer/intern position (10 hrs/week) for someone who wants to be part of something groundbreaking—and get in early.
 What You’d Be Helping With:
• Coordinating tasks and timelines for our Phase 1 launch (35,000 sq ft space)
• Building simple systems: SOPs, hiring plans, budgets, merch prep
• Helping organize large moving parts into manageable weekly goals
• Drafting outreach emails, scheduling contacts, managing follow-ups
• Supporting creative direction, floorplans, or launch content (if that’s your lane)
 You Might Be a Great Fit If You:
• Have project coordination or operations experience
• Care about accessible, community-rooted spaces
• Love helping visionaries organize and execute
• Can commit 5–10 hours/week (remote, flexible)
 This is unpaid—for now.
But you’ll:
• Work closely with me (the founder)
• Get credited on all Phase 1 materials
• Be first in line for paid roles or grant-backed contracts
• Help shape a movement from the inside
If you're interested, send me:
• A short intro about you
• What you're passionate about
• What kind of work you’re best at
• Your general availability
Let’s build something the world hasn’t seen yet.
