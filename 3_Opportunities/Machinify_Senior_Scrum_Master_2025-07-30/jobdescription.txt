About the job
Who We Are

Machinify is a leading healthcare intelligence company with expertise across the payment continuum, delivering unmatched value, transparency, and efficiency to health plan clients across the country. Deployed by over 60 health plans, including many of the top 20, and representing more than 160 million lives, Machinify brings together a fully configurable and content-rich, AI-powered platform along with best-in-class expertise. We’re constantly reimagining what’s possible in our industry, creating disruptively simple, powerfully clear ways to maximize financial outcomes and drive down healthcare costs.

Location: This role is fully remote

About the Role

We’re seeking a Senior Scrum Master who combines deep delivery experience with the ability to guide teams through ambiguity, complexity, and change. In this role, you won’t just manage ceremonies — you’ll be a hands-on driver of progress who helps teams stay focused, efficient, and aligned. Our teams support healthcare payment integrity solutions for health insurance clients, and your role will be critical in helping them deliver complex, data-driven products in an environment that may be unfamiliar with formal Agile practices. You’ll adapt Agile methods to meet the needs of the team and organization, while coaching individuals and leaders to embrace structure without rigidity.

Key Responsibilities

Drive Agile Delivery: Facilitate planning, stand-ups, reviews, and retrospectives to keep teams focused on execution and delivery of value for our health insurance clients.
Coach and Mentor Teams: Support individuals and teams — especially those newer to Agile — with clear, practical coaching; help them understand the “why,” not just the “how.”
Apply Agile Pragmatically: Tailor your approach based on team maturity, business goals, and delivery constraints. You’ll flex between Scrum, Kanban, or hybrid models as appropriate.
Partner Across Functions: Collaborate closely with Product, Engineering, Data Science, QA, and Business Operations to ensure alignment and effective delivery across complex workflows.
Handle Resistance with Empathy: Help teams and stakeholders adopt new ways of working — even when there’s skepticism or pushback — by building trust and demonstrating outcomes.
Foster Accountability and Improvement: Guide teams to own their processes and continuously improve, using retrospectives and team metrics to drive sustainable delivery.
Navigate Industry-Specific Complexity: Understand how healthcare data, regulatory concerns, and client expectations in the payer space shape timelines and product development realities.

5+ years of experience as a Scrum Master or Agile Delivery Lead
Proven track record of leading Agile delivery in complex environments
Ability to coach and mentor teams with varying levels of Agile maturity
Strong facilitation, conflict resolution, and stakeholder engagement skills
Experience working in data-heavy environments with cross-functional product teams
Comfortable adapting Agile approaches to fit the realities of the team and organization

Preferred Qualifications

Experience in healthcare, especially in payment integrity, revenue cycle, or working with health insurance carriers
Familiarity with HIPAA, data security considerations, or payer-provider workflows
Certifications such as Certified ScrumMaster (CSM), SAFe Agilist, PMI-ACP, or ICAgile
Experience with tools like Jira, Azure DevOps, Confluence, Miro, or similar
Exposure to Lean principles, continuous improvement, or organizational change management

Success After 3 Months

You’ve built trust with your teams and are facilitating effective, focused ceremonies
Agile practices are adapted to team needs and embedded in daily workflows
You’ve identified and implemented a few tangible improvements that make delivery smoother
Teams are showing increased ownership, clarity, and momentum
Business stakeholders see you as a partner who helps make work visible and predictable

Success After 1 Year

Teams have matured in Agile practices, delivering consistently and adapting to change
Agile has spread beyond your immediate teams — others are asking you for guidance
You’ve helped shape cross-team or cross-functional improvements in delivery operations
Business partners and clients see real value from how your teams operate
You’ve influenced the broader Agile culture in the organization with a pragmatic, results-oriented mindset
