SUBJECT: Application for Manager, Technical Program Management Office at Paylocity
CONTENT: 
Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Manager, Technical Program Management Office position at Paylocity, which I discovered on LinkedIn. With over 10 years of experience leading complex technical programs and building high-performing project management teams, I am confident I possess the skills and leadership background required to excel in this role and contribute to your mission of empowering the modern workforce.
<br><br>
In my recent role as Senior Project Manager, I encountered the challenge of aligning over 15 cross-functional teams and 100+ personnel for Banco de Chile under a disjointed project structure. I took action by designing and implementing a Scrum of Scrums framework, creating standardized reporting mechanisms with KPIs and OKRs, and establishing a new governance model. The result was a cohesive program delivery structure that improved communication, provided clear visibility to senior leadership, and ensured consistent execution across the portfolio.
<br><br>
My background includes hands-on experience in PMO transformation, defining and implementing best practices, and mentoring teams of project and scrum masters to elevate their performance and advance their careers. I have a track record of managing program intake, resource capacity, risk, and dependencies for large-scale software initiatives, including AI-driven solutions and cloud platform migrations, leading to measurable outcomes like a 40% improvement in e-commerce platform performance for Dick's Sporting Goods.
<br><br>
I am particularly drawn to Paylocity's commitment to building a strong workplace culture through innovative HR technology. My passion lies in creating environments where teams can thrive and deliver compelling software, and I am eager to apply my experience in talent development and program governance to help your Product & Technology organization continue to innovate and lead the market.
