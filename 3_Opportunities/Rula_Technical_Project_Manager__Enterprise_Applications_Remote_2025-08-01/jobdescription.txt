Job Description:
About the job
We believe that mental health is just as important as physical health. We recognize that mental health issues can be complex and multifaceted, and we are dedicated to treating the whole person, not just the symptoms.

We aim to create a world where mental health is no longer stigmatized or marginalized, but rather is embraced as an integral part of one's overall well-being.

We believe that by providing quality care that is both evidence-based and compassionate, we can empower individuals to take charge of their mental health and achieve their full potential. We are passionate about making a positive impact on the lives of those struggling with mental health issues and we strive to be a force for positive change in the field of mental healthcare.

About The Role

Join Rula as a Technical Project Manager and help scale the systems that power accessible mental healthcare. You’ll lead high-impact, cross-functional projects within our Enterprise Applications team, delivering improvements across tools like Salesforce, Ironclad, Outreach, and Gong. Collaborating closely with stakeholders from Sales, Engineering, Product, and Operations, you'll transform complex business needs into scalable tech solutions. Our team thrives on collaboration, curiosity, and a strong delivery mindset—this is a great opportunity for someone excited by systems thinking, stakeholder partnership, and driving real impact across a mission-driven organization.

Required Qualifications

6+ years of technical project management experience, including at least 4 years in a GTM environment (e.g., Sales, Finance, or Marketing).
Proven track record of managing cross-functional projects involving Sales, Product, Marketing, Finance, or Success.
Experience using Agile methodologies (e.g., sprints, stand-ups, retrospectives) to lead projects from scoping to deployment.
Strong familiarity with tools in the business systems ecosystem (e.g., Salesforce, Gong, Ironclad, Outreach, LeanData, or HubSpot).
Excellent communication and stakeholder management skills, with the ability to convey complex technical concepts in a clear, concise and business-relevant manner.

Preferred Qualifications

While having the preferred qualifications enhances your candidacy, having all of them is not mandatory. We encourage all interested applicants to apply, even those who may not meet every preferred requirement.

Experience delivering projects in healthcare tech, mental health services, or other regulated environments (e.g., HIPAA).
2+ years of hands-on experience with Salesforce (e.g., Sales Cloud, Health Cloud, Flows, Apex, or integrations), either as a PM or Admin.
Salesforce Business Analyst or UX Designer certification (or equivalent experience).
Demonstrated experience working with distributed technical teams across multiple time zones.
Background managing people or coaching cross-functional teams (even in a non-manager role).
Bachelor's degree in a relevant field.

100% remote work environment (US-based only): Working hours to support a healthy work-life balance, ensuring you can meet both professional and personal commitments
Attractive pay and benefits: Full transparency of pay ranges regardless of where you live in the United States
