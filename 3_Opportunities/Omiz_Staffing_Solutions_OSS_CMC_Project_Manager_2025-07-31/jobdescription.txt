About the job
🔹 Hiring: Technical Project Manager – Combination Products (REMOTE | United States)🔹

🚀 Make a global impact by managing innovative combination product programs at a leading Biotech giant!

We’re looking for a highly technical and experienced Project Manager to lead complex, cross-functional projects in the combination product (drug-device) space. This is not your typical project management role — we're seeking a strategic thinker who thrives in regulated environments, understands design control processes, and excels with Smartsheet tools.

Role: Project Manager
📍 Location: Remote (United States)
💵 Pay Rate: $70 – $75/hour (W2)
📅 Contract: 1 year (with potential extension)

🔧 Key Responsibilities
✔️ Lead full lifecycle project management for technical combination product initiatives.
✔️ Manage timelines, resources, and cross-functional collaboration across Quality, Engineering, Regulatory, and Human Factors.
✔️ Develop Smartsheet-based dashboards, Gantt charts, and reports to drive visibility and execution.
✔️ Track key milestones and adapt plans to meet evolving business needs.
✔️ Champion CMC processes and ensure compliance with global device regulations.

🎯 Must-Have Qualifications
✅ 3+ years managing projects in combination product or medical device development
✅ Strong engineering background with working knowledge of Chemistry Manufacturing Control (CMC)
✅ Expert-level Smartsheet skills (creation, integration, dashboarding)
✅ Deep understanding of design control for medical devices
✅ Excellent communication and stakeholder management skills

⚠️ Please Note:
❌ This is not an IT, Supply Chain, or Construction PM role
❌ Candidates without combination product or device experience will not be considered

💡 Why Join?
Be part of one of the world’s leading biotechnology companies, where your project leadership will support the development of life-saving combination products. Collaborate across Quality, Regulatory, and Engineering to bring advanced therapies to patients worldwide.
