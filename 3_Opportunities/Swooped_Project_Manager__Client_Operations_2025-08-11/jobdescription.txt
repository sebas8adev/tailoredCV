Job Description:
About the job
About Our Client
Our client is an innovative health plan for self-funded employers on a mission to bring affordable, high-quality healthcare to the millions who struggle to pay their healthcare bills. Anchored around a primary care based ACO model, the organization saves employers 15 to 30 percent compared to traditional insurance carriers. Employees also realize significant savings through free primary care (including virtual), predictable copay and no-deductible benefit plan design. The organization works with employers ranging in size from 51 employees to Fortune 500 companies.

About the Role
Our client exists for workers and their employers, who are the backbone of the economy. The mission is to bring affordable, high-quality healthcare to the millions who struggle to pay their healthcare bills.

Key Responsibilities
Project Planning: Develop project plans that outline objectives, scope, timelines, resources, and deliverables. This involves understanding the goals of the project and breaking them down into manageable tasks.

Resource Management: Allocate resources effectively, including personnel, budget, and equipment, to ensure project tasks are completed on time and within budget.

Stakeholder Communication: Facilitate communication among stakeholders, including internal teams, external vendors, and leadership, to ensure everyone is informed about project progress, changes, and issues.

Risk Management: Identify potential risks and develop strategies to mitigate them. This involves assessing the impact of risks on project objectives and implementing measures to minimize their effects.

Quality Assurance: Establish and enforce quality standards to ensure that project deliverables meet the required level of quality. This may involve conducting quality reviews, testing, and validation processes.

Timeline Management: Monitor project timelines and milestones to ensure timely completion of tasks. Adjust schedules and resource allocations as needed to address delays or changes in project scope.

Issue Resolution: Identify and address issues that arise during the project lifecycle, such as conflicts among team members, technical challenges, or changes in requirements.

Documentation and Reporting: Maintain accurate records of project activities, including meeting minutes, progress reports, and documentation of decisions and changes. Provide regular updates to stakeholders on project status and performance.

Change Management: Manage changes to project scope, objectives, or requirements, ensuring that any modifications are properly documented, communicated, and approved by relevant stakeholders.

Post-Project Evaluation: Conduct post-project evaluations to assess the success of the project, identify lessons learned, and make recommendations for future improvements.

Values
Resilient: This is challenging. There is no easy button for healthcare affordability. The mission makes it worth it and sustains the team when things are tough. Being resilient ensures persistence.

Uncommon: The status quo is not ideal, so something better had to be built. The healthcare system is not working for members, employers, and providers. Therefore, it is being built from scratch, from the ground up. The focus is on making things better for them while also improving clinical results, which is bold and uncommon.
  Positive: Care is given to each other. It takes energy to do hard things, build something better, and be resilient and unconventional while doing it. Because of this, kudos are given freely and feedback is provided with care. When energy is low, a team member is there to provide new energy. The team celebrates together. They are supportive, generous, humble, and positive.

Compensation
$105K – $115K • Offers Equity • Offers Bonus
