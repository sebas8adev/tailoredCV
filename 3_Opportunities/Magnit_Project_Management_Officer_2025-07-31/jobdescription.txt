About the Role

The project is a payment strategy project that is a dedicated B2B payment rail enabling low-cost, instant, 24/7 domestic and cross-border payments. 
Capture high-value off-platform transactions with automated reconciliation. 
This is a strategic role focusing on cross-functional execution, with direct accountability for ensuring timelines, transparency, and delivery integrity across global teams.

Program Oversight & Timeline Management:
Own and manage the overall project plan, driving adherence to timelines and milestones across multiple workstreams.

Risk & Issue Tracking
Establish and maintain a robust framework for identifying, documenting, escalating, and resolving program-level risks and issues.
Monitor key risk indicators and ensure mitigation plans are in place and executed.
Dependency Management
Identify and manage critical interdependencies across internal teams, systems, and geographies.
Drive alignment across stakeholders to de-risk cross-functional deliverables.
Reporting & Communication
Produce and distribute concise, executive-ready project updates and dashboards.
Act as the primary point of contact for project status, ensuring stakeholders at all levels are informed and engaged.
Cross-Location Coordination
Coordinate activities across multi-location teams including engineering, product, risk, compliance, and operations.
Adapt project governance to suit various time zones and team structures.
Governance & Documentation
Maintain accurate and up-to-date documentation of meeting notes, action items, decision logs, and program artefacts.

Basic Qualifications
5+ years of program or project management experience, preferably in a product-focused environment within a global tech or financial services company.
Demonstrated experience in managing risk-oriented technology projects.

Excellent organizational and communication skills; able to distill complexity into actionable plans.
Strong understanding of product lifecycle and risk workflows.
Experience working with globally distributed teams.
Other Qualifications 
PMP or other project management certifications.
Prior exposure to risk systems, fraud prevention workflows, or payment holds mechanics.
Experience working in agile environments.
