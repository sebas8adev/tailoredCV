SUBJECT: Application for Project & Budget Coordinator at Thermo Fisher Scientific
CONTENT: 
Dear Hiring Manager,
<br><br>
I am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in the Project & Budget Coordinator position at Thermo Fisher Scientific, as advertised on LinkedIn. With over 10 years of experience in project management, I have developed a strong expertise in the precise financial oversight, budget coordination, and resource planning that this role requires.
<br><br>
In my previous roles, I have consistently addressed challenges related to financial control and resource management. For instance, when faced with potential budget overruns due to inaccurate forecasting, I implemented rigorous financial monitoring systems. By meticulously tracking actuals against forecasts and managing resource allocations for clients like Royal Caribbean Group, I improved budget adherence by over 15% and effectively minimized financial risks associated with unsupported work.
<br><br>
Furthermore, I have successfully standardized financial processes across complex, multi-million dollar programs. I developed and applied unified procedures for budget tracking and reporting using tools like Jira and MS Office, ensuring clear documentation and compliance. This action provided C-level stakeholders with transparent RAG status reports, enhancing visibility and enabling proactive, data-driven decisions on the project portfolio.
<br><br>
I am particularly drawn to Thermo Fisher Scientific's mission to enable customers to make the world healthier, cleaner, and safer. My skills in detailed financial coordination and ensuring project compliance are perfectly suited to supporting the high-impact projects that drive this mission forward. I am confident I can contribute to your team's success by applying my adaptive approach to project and budget coordination.
