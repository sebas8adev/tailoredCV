SUBJECT: Application for Assistant Project Manager - Data Centers at Top 10 Design-build firm
CONTENT: 
Dear Joseph Hall,
<br><br>
I am writing to express my keen interest in the Assistant Project Manager - Data Centers position I discovered on LinkedIn. With over 10 years of experience managing complex, large-scale technology projects, including data center migrations and critical infrastructure deployments, I am confident that my skills align perfectly with the requirements of this role.
<br><br>
In a previous role, I was tasked with leading the complex migration of a major financial institution's on-premise data center to a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) environment. I took charge of the end-to-end project management, coordinating with cross-functional engineering, IT, and operations teams, while managing all vendor contracts and timelines. The result was a seamless migration with zero downtime, ensuring full business continuity and enhancing operational scalability for the client.
<br><br>
Furthermore, my experience includes managing the IT infrastructure lifecycle for over 60 corporate sites. This involved a significant capital project to implement a new access control system, where I led the coordination between construction teams, hardware vendors, and internal IT staff. This project was delivered on schedule and within budget, successfully standardizing security and operations across multiple countries.
<br><br>
The opportunity to contribute to a Top 10 Design-build firm that is expanding its Project Management division is incredibly compelling. I am passionate about building the foundational infrastructure that powers our digital world, and my background in managing capital projects, stakeholders, and compliance is directly transferable to delivering the high-quality data center projects your firm is known for.
<br><br>
I am eager to discuss how my adaptive project management approach and hands-on experience can benefit your team. Thank you for your time and consideration.
