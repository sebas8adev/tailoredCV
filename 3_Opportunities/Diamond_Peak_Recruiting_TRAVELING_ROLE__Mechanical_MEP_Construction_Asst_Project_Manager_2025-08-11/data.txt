SUBJECT: Application for Traveling Mechanical (MEP) Construction Asst. Project Manager at Diamond Peak Recruiting
CONTENT: Dear Hiring Manager,
<br><br>
I am writing to express my strong interest in the Traveling Mechanical Assistant Project Manager position I found on LinkedIn. With over 10 years of experience in leading large-scale, technically complex projects, I am drawn to this field-forward leadership opportunity and am fully prepared for the 100% travel commitment. My background is rooted in managing projects with significant hardware, infrastructure, and multi-site deployment components, skills I am confident will translate directly to the demands of MEP construction.
<br><br>
For instance, a significant challenge in my career involved managing the technology infrastructure rollout across more than 60 new sites for Bodytech. I took charge of the entire project lifecycle, from planning and budgeting to coordinating vendors and on-site installation teams for networking, CCTV, and physical access control systems. My action in leading this multi-country initiative resulted in the successful, on-schedule launch of all sites, directly enabling the company’s aggressive expansion goals.
<br><br>
Similarly, at TIPI, I led a project for the Colombian Police that required the deployment of an integrated hardware-software solution. I was responsible for the operational rollout of over 3,000 bodycam units and their corresponding docking stations in multiple cities. This involved direct on-site coordination, managing installation, and ensuring seamless integration with the central management software. The result was a successful city-wide implementation that enhanced operational capabilities and safety for law enforcement.
<br><br>
I am deeply impressed by the opportunity to apply my robust project management framework—including rigorous budget control, schedule adherence, and subcontractor oversight—to the dynamic environment of commercial construction. I am a fast learner, eager to immerse myself in the specifics of HVAC systems and industry codes, and I am excited by the prospect of contributing to a growing national team and delivering exceptional project outcomes.
