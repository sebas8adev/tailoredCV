SUBJECT: Application for Project Manager, ASC (Remote) at Stryker
CONTENT: 
Dear Hiring Manager,
<br><br>
I am writing to express my strong interest in the Project Manager, ASC (Remote) position at Stryker, as advertised on LinkedIn. My extensive background in managing complex, cross-functional projects, particularly within the healthcare and medical device sectors, aligns perfectly with the requirements of this role. I am confident that my experience in coordinating technology implementations and engaging with clinical stakeholders will allow me to contribute significantly to your team.
<br><br>
In a previous role, my healthcare clients faced the challenge of integrating disparate medical systems to improve clinical workflows and data accessibility. I took charge by leading the end-to-end project management for imaging integration (DICOM), surgery event management, and voice-to-text solutions for multiple hospitals. This involved acting as the primary point of contact for clinical staff, coordinating with technical teams, and managing vendor deliverables. As a result, we successfully launched integrated systems that enhanced data access for physicians and streamlined critical patient care processes.
<br><br>
My experience extends to managing the logistics of hardware and software deployments, a key responsibility outlined in your job description. At TIPI, I directed the rollout of over 3,000 bodycams, a project that required meticulous coordination of hardware installation, firmware updates, and user training across multiple cities. This hands-on experience in managing projects from initiation through delivery, ensuring seamless coordination between supply chain, technical teams, and end-users, has prepared me to effectively manage the implementation of Stryker's ASC agreements.
<br><br>
I am particularly drawn to Stryker's mission and the opportunity to facilitate a seamless customer experience for new and expanding surgery centers. My ability to lead without direct authority, combined with a deep understanding of both technical and business requirements, will enable me to support your regional managers and drive successful project outcomes that directly impact patient care.
