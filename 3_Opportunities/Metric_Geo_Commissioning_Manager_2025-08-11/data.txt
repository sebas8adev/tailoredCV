SUBJECT: Application for Commissioning Manager at Metric Geo
CONTENT: 
Dear Donnacha Mescal,
<br><br>
I am writing to express my keen interest in the Commissioning Manager position, as advertised on LinkedIn. While my professional background is rooted in managing complex digital and cloud infrastructure projects, I am drawn to this opportunity by the challenge of applying my rigorous project leadership and systems integration expertise to the mission-critical physical infrastructure sector. My career has been dedicated to ensuring the flawless delivery of high-value, technically complex systems where operational integrity is paramount.
<br><br>
In my role at Globant, I was tasked with leading projects where system failure was not an option. For instance, I managed the critical migration of Banco de Chileâ€™s on-premise datacenter to Google Cloud Platform. I led a team of over 100 professionals to execute a meticulous plan, managing all risks, coordinating with stakeholders, and ensuring absolute business continuity. The result was a seamless transition with zero unplanned downtime, safeguarding the bank's core operations.
<br><br>
Furthermore, my experience extends to managing integrated hardware and software deployments. At TIPI, I directed the end-to-end delivery of a bodycam system for the Colombian Police. This involved overseeing firmware development, hardware manufacturing, and the operational rollout and support for over 3,000 devices in the field. This project demonstrates my capability to manage the entire lifecycle of a physical technology product, from conception to in-service support, under stringent government contract regulations.
<br><br>
I am confident that my adaptive project management approach and my experience in leading large teams to deliver complex, high-stakes technology projects are directly transferable to the demands of a Commissioning Manager. I am eager to bring my skills in budget control, risk mitigation, and stakeholder management to your team.
