SUBJECT: Application for Project Manager at Recex.co
CONTENT: <p>Dear Hiring Manager,</p><br>
<p>I am writing to express my keen interest in the Project Manager position at Recex.co, as advertised on LinkedIn.  My 10+ years of experience in managing complex projects across diverse industries, including  e-commerce, retail, banking, and travel/hospitality, aligns perfectly with the requirements outlined in the job description.  My adaptive approach to project management, leveraging both Agile (SAFe, Scrum, Kanban) and traditional methodologies, ensures successful delivery within budget and timeline constraints.</p><br>
<p>Throughout my career, I have consistently demonstrated the ability to deliver exceptional results.  At Globant, a leading AI-driven software development and consulting company, I successfully managed multiple large-scale projects for high-profile clients such as Royal Caribbean and Dick's Sporting Goods, consistently exceeding expectations.

<p>My technical proficiency extends to AutoCAD, Microsoft Excel (including advanced functions and pivot tables), and various project management platforms such as Jira and Confluence. While my experience is primarily in software development and related fields, my proven ability to manage budgets, timelines, and stakeholder communication is directly transferable to the construction industry.
