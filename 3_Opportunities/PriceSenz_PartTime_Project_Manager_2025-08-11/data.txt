SUBJECT: Application for Part-Time Project Manager at PriceSenz
CONTENT: 
Dear Manu V George,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Part-Time Project Manager position at PriceSenz, which I discovered on LinkedIn. The opportunity to apply my project management expertise in a focused, part-time contract role is an excellent match for my current career goals, and I am confident that my background in managing complex technical projects aligns perfectly with your requirements.
<br><br>
The job description emphasizes the need to manage projects with complex integrations and diverse stakeholders. In my role at Globant, I was responsible for leading multifaceted digital initiatives for clients like Royal Caribbean and Dick's Sporting Goods. I managed globally distributed teams, controlled project budgets and scope, and served as the primary communication link to C-level stakeholders. A key achievement was leading an e-commerce platform overhaul that resulted in a 40% improvement in Core Web Vitals performance, directly enhancing the user experience and business outcomes.
<br><br>
I understand this role requires solid experience with enterprise content management (ECM) systems. While managing the digital platform for Dick’s Sporting Goods, I led project teams working with Adobe Experience Manager (AEM), a leading ECM solution. My responsibilities included overseeing the development of new page components, managing content workflows, and executing performance enhancements, giving me direct, hands-on experience with the challenges and successes of large-scale ECM projects.
<br><br>
My approach to project management is both adaptive and disciplined, rooted in over a decade of experience with Agile methodologies, including SAFe and Scrum. As a certified ScrumMaster (A-CSM) and SAFe Agilist, I excel at guiding teams to deliver value iteratively while maintaining clear project tracking and risk mitigation. I am adept at working independently and am skilled in planning, tracking, and reporting on project progress to ensure alignment with organizational standards and deliver results on time and within scope.

I am eager to discuss how my skills in project management, ECM systems, and stakeholder communication can support PriceSenz's ongoing initiatives. Thank you for your time and consideration.
