SUBJECT: Application for Project Manager, Clinical Supplies at Thermo Fisher Scientific
CONTENT: Dear Hiring Manager,<br><br>I am writing to express my keen interest in the Project Manager, Clinical Supplies position at Thermo Fisher Scientific, as advertised on LinkedIn. Your mission to enable customers to make the world healthier, cleaner, and safer deeply resonates with my professional background in managing technology projects within the healthcare and other highly regulated sectors.<br><br>In my previous roles, I have consistently confronted the challenge of delivering complex, multi-faceted projects under strict regulatory and compliance constraints. At Globant, I was responsible for a datacenter migration for a major bank, where the problem was ensuring zero-downtime and adherence to stringent financial regulations. I led the planning and execution, coordinating with global teams and stakeholders to manage risks and timelines. The result was a successful migration to GCP, completed on schedule and in full compliance with all security and regulatory mandates.<br><br>The core of this role, managing global clinical supplies, requires meticulous logistical planning and supply chain oversight. While leading a project for the Colombian Police at TIPI, I faced the challenge of deploying over 3,000 integrated hardware devices across multiple cities. My action was to develop and manage the entire supply chain, from firmware installation and hardware logistics to software deployment and support. This resulted in a successful, on-time, nationwide rollout, demonstrating my capability to manage complex, tangible asset delivery from end to end.<br><br>My experience managing projects for clinics and hospitals, including medical imaging integrations and voice-to-text apps for physicians, has given me a solid understanding of the clinical environment. I am confident that my adaptive project management approach and my skills in planning, client relationship management, and leading global teams align perfectly with the requirements of this role and Thermo Fisher Scientific's innovative culture.
