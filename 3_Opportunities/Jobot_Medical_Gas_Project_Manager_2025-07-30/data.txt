SUBJECT: Application for Medical Gas Project Manager
CONTENT: Dear Logan Ridge,<br><br>I am writing to express my keen interest in the Medical Gas Project Manager position I found on LinkedIn.

My experience in the healthcare sector involved delivering system integrations for hospitals, adhering to strict data standards like HL7 and DICOM, and ensuring operational continuity.
