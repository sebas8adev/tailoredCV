SUBJECT: Application for Business Project Manager – Project Governance & Planning at DivIHN Integration Inc
CONTENT: Dear Remya Mukundan,
<br><br>
I am writing to express my keen interest in the Business Project Manager – Project Governance & Planning role advertised on LinkedIn. With over 10 years of experience leading complex, cross-functional initiatives and a strong background in business operations, I am confident in my ability to develop the comprehensive project governance framework and detailed project plans your long-term care client requires.

In my previous roles, particularly at Globant, I was responsible for designing and implementing project governance structures for clients in highly regulated industries like finance and healthcare. This included defining KPIs, establishing C-level reporting mechanisms, managing risks, and creating robust, actionable project plans that aligned scope, budget, and resources with strategic goals. My experience directly mirrors the core responsibilities of this role, including leading initiatives for wellness and strategic claims.
<br><br>
My expertise includes facilitating stakeholder workshops to ensure alignment, defining clear roles and escalation paths, and leveraging tools like Jira within Agile environments to drive execution. I have a history of successfully guiding teams through complex projects, ensuring adherence to governance while maintaining the flexibility to adapt to changing needs.
<br><br>
The opportunity to apply my skills in project governance and business operations to a 46-month strategic initiative is very appealing. I am eager to discuss how my background can deliver immediate and sustained value. Thank you for your time and consideration.
