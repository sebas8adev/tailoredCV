SUBJECT: Application for Business Analyst/Project Manager at TWO95 International's Client
CONTENT: Dear Joseph Prabakar,<br><br>I am writing to express my strong interest in the Business Analyst/Project Manager position I found on LinkedIn, which is being managed by TWO95 International. With over 10 years of experience leading complex IT projects from inception to completion, my background in bridging business requirements with technical execution aligns perfectly with the needs of your client.<br><br>In a previous role, the challenge was to manage large-scale digital transformation projects within ambiguous settings and tight budgets. I took the initiative to lead requirements gathering sessions with business SMEs for Dick's Sporting Goods' e-commerce platform, creating a structured roadmap and documenting functional requirements. By applying a hybrid Agile approach and managing project costs effectively, we delivered a 40% improvement in Core Web Vitals, directly enhancing the customer experience and platform performance.<br><br>I understand the ability to manage stakeholders and deliver clear status reports is crucial. As a project manager for banking and travel clients, I developed and presented detailed project updates to C-level sponsors, articulating progress, risks, and budget adherence using clear PowerPoint presentations. This ensured stakeholder alignment and kept cross-functional teams on course toward achieving project goals, successfully launching new features like an AI-powered chatbot for Royal Caribbean.<br><br>I noted that experience in the healthcare industry is a plus. I bring direct experience managing projects for clinics and hospitals, including the development of medical imaging integrations and voice-to-text applications for physicians. My ability to quickly learn new domains and take ownership, combined with my proficiency in MS Project, Jira, and the full MS Office suite, makes me confident I can deliver immediate value to your client.<br><br>Thank you for your time and consideration. I am eager to discuss how my adaptive project management skills and business acumen can contribute to your client's success.
