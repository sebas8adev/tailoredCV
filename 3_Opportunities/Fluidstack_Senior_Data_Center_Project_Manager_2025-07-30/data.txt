SUBJECT: Application for Senior Data Center Project Manager at Fluidstack
CONTENT: Dear Hiring Manager,
<br><br>
I am writing to express my strong interest in the Senior Data Center Project Manager position at Fluidstack, as advertised on LinkedIn. With over 10 years of experience managing large-scale technical projects, including datacenter migrations and multi-site infrastructure deployments, I am confident I possess the skills and leadership to drive your global data center initiatives.
<br><br>
In my previous roles, I have been directly responsible for the full project lifecycle, from initial RFP analysis and planning to budget ownership, risk mitigation, and execution. For instance, I led the datacenter migration from on-premise to GCP for Banco de Chile and managed the technology infrastructure rollout for over 60 sites at Bodytech. I excel at creating detailed project plans, managing complex dependencies, and serving as the single source of truth for executive stakeholders through clear, concise status reporting and KPI tracking.
<br><br>
My background in Systems Engineering and hands-on experience with both hardware/software integrations and cloud platforms (AWS, GCP) provide me with a unique perspective to partner effectively with your construction and design teams. I am adept at translating ambitious capacity targets into executable plans and ensuring all stakeholders remain aligned from kickoff to handover.
<br><br>
I am deeply impressed by Fluidstack's mission to build world-class GPU supercomputers and am eager to contribute my expertise in project management to help you achieve your ambitious goals. I am excited by the opportunity to bring my adaptive project management approach to your team.
<br><br>
Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to discussing how my experience can benefit Fluidstack.
