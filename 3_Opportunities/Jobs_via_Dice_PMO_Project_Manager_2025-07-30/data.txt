SUBJECT: Application for PMO Project Manager at Sitek
CONTENT: Dear Hiring Manager,<br><br>I am writing to express my keen interest in the PMO Project Manager position with Sitek for the Cabinet of Health and Family Service - Office of Application Technology Services (OATS), as advertised on LinkedIn. My extensive background in establishing and enforcing project management methodologies, mentoring project managers, and enhancing operational frameworks aligns perfectly with the responsibilities of this role.<br><br>Throughout my 10+ years of experience, I have specialized in building and leading high-performance teams and standardizing processes across large-scale programs.

I have a strong track record of developing documentation, conducting training, and auditing project performance to ensure alignment with organizational standards. With a Bachelor's in Systems Engineering and certifications including SAFe 6 Agilist, A-CSM, and Google Project Management, I possess both the strategic oversight and the technical acumen to contribute significantly to the CHFS OATS PMO.<br><br>I am confident that my skills in process enhancement, data-driven decision-making, and fostering collaborative, high-maturity environments make me an excellent candidate to help elevate your PMO's activities and performance. I am eager to discuss how I can help propagate positive change and ensure project success across the cabinet.
