SUBJECT: Application for HCM Project Manager, Private Equity at PayTech
CONTENT: 
Dear Gregg Fairweather,
<br><br>
I am writing to express my strong interest in the HCM Project Manager, Private Equity role at PayTech, as advertised on LinkedIn. With over 10 years of experience leading complex, high-stakes technology projects and acting as a strategic consultant for enterprise clients, I am confident in my ability to deliver the transformational results your private equity partners and their portfolio companies expect.
<br><br>
In my role at Globant, a key challenge was ensuring that large-scale digital transformation projects for clients like Dick's Sporting Goods delivered measurable value while navigating complex stakeholder landscapes. I took ownership of the entire project lifecycle, developing strategic roadmaps, leading PI planning sessions, and establishing clear KPIs to track progress against business objectives. This hands-on, adaptive approach resulted in a 40% improvement in e-commerce platform performance and consistently on-time, on-budget delivery, directly aligning technology investments with value creation goals.
<br><br>
Similarly, when tasked with a major datacenter migration for Banco de Chile, I addressed the problem of coordinating a massive, distributed workforce by designing and implementing a Scrum of Scrums framework. I led the strategic staffing of over 150 technical roles and mentored five other scrum masters, creating a high-performing PMO structure. The result was a successful, large-scale systems integration that met all strategic objectives, showcasing my ability to manage the technical and human capital aspects of transformational initiatives, much like those in an M&A context.
<br><br>
I am particularly drawn to PayTech's focus on becoming a trusted strategic partner within the private equity ecosystem. My career has been dedicated to not just managing projects, but to understanding client objectives, identifying new opportunities for value, and guiding C-suite stakeholders through critical decisions. I am eager to apply my expertise in risk mitigation, strategic planning, and team leadership to help your clients maximize their HCM system utilization and achieve their investment thesis.
