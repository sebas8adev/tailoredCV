SUBJECT: Application for Project Manager at Jack
CONTENT: 
Dear Hiring Manager,
<br><br>
I am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in the Project Manager position at Jack, as advertised on LinkedIn. Your focus on building a real-time data streaming technology that transforms industries is inspiring, and I am particularly drawn to this roleâ€™s unique position at the intersection of project management and People Operations. My background in leading complex, cross-functional initiatives in high-growth tech environments aligns directly with the operational leadership you are seeking.
<br><br>
In my role at Globant, I faced the challenge of rapidly scaling technical teams for a major banking client to meet aggressive transformation goals. The problem was ensuring consistent, high-quality talent acquisition and integration without disrupting project momentum. I took action by designing and implementing a comprehensive staffing framework that streamlined the entire process from requirement definition to onboarding for over 150 positions. This involved creating standardized processes that functioned like an internal ATS, improving how we identified, interviewed, and placed candidates. The result was the successful formation of 15 high-performance teams, which was critical to delivering the client's digital transformation program on schedule.
<br><br>
Another critical challenge was maintaining stakeholder alignment and operational efficiency across multiple fast-paced projects for clients like Dick's Sporting Goods. To solve this, I developed and scaled project management best practices, including creating clear KPI dashboards and executive-level reporting frameworks. By translating complex project data into actionable insights and RAG statuses, I drove clear communication and data-informed decision-making. This action directly contributed to a 40% improvement in e-commerce platform performance and ensured all cross-functional teams were aligned with strategic objectives and key milestones.
<br><br>
My experience in strategic planning, risk mitigation, and fostering collaboration has prepared me to be the "operational glue" for your People function. I am confident I can help scale your frameworks, drive key initiatives, and contribute to Jack's collaborative and feedback-driven culture. Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to discussing how my skills can support your team.
