SUBJECT: Application for Project Manager Lead 2 (Remote) at Texas Education Agency
CONTENT: 
Dear Hiring Manager,
<br><br>
I am writing to express my keen interest in the Project Manager Lead 2 position with the Texas Education Agency, which I discovered on LinkedIn. With over 10 years of experience leading complex, multi-stakeholder technology projects, my background in managing enterprise content management solutions, government contracts, and state-level budget tracking aligns directly with the key requirements of this role.
<br><br>
In a recent project for a major retail client, the challenge was to overhaul a complex e-commerce platform with numerous integrations and stakeholders. I led a 30+ person team in an Agile environment to manage and enhance their Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) enterprise content solution. By driving the project roadmap and facilitating cross-functional alignment, we successfully improved the platform's Core Web Vitals by 40%, significantly enhancing performance and user experience.
<br><br>
Furthermore, my experience includes managing projects within strict regulatory and contractual frameworks. For the Colombian Police, I directed a project to deliver an integrated bodycam and software solution. My role involved leading the project from proposal to deployment, defining all constraints based on the government contract, and managing the budget to ensure compliance. This resulted in the on-time, on-budget delivery of over 3,000 units, establishing a critical public safety system.
<br><br>
The opportunity to apply my adaptive project management skills to support the Texas Education Agency's mission is highly compelling. My expertise in managing budgets, contracts, and senior stakeholder expectations in both public and private sectors has prepared me to deliver value and drive key initiatives successfully within your organization.
<br><br>
Thank you for considering my application. I am confident that my leadership experience and technical project management skills would make me a valuable asset to your team.
