SUBJECT: Application for Comprehensive Disaster Recovery Project Manager at Hagerty Consulting
CONTENT: Dear Aly Delaney,
<br><br>
I am writing to express my strong interest in the Comprehensive Disaster Recovery Project Manager position at Hagerty Consulting, which I discovered on LinkedIn. I understand this opportunity is for consideration within your Recovery Cadre pipeline, and I am keen to be part of a team dedicated to making a tangible impact on community resilience and recovery.
<br><br>
With over 10 years of experience managing complex, large-scale projects for diverse clients, including public safety and government entities, I have a strong foundation in the core competencies this role requires. My background involves leading large, multi-disciplinary teams of over 100 professionals, managing project constraints, and ensuring the delivery of high-quality outcomes under demanding conditions. I have extensive experience in strategic planning, proposal development, and full lifecycle project execution, which I am confident are directly transferable to managing federal disaster grant programs and supporting local governments.

My adaptive approach to project management, utilizing both Agile and traditional frameworks, has been instrumental in navigating dynamic environments and delivering results. I excel at translating complex requirements into actionable plans, fostering clear communication with high-level stakeholders, and using data-driven reporting (KPIs/OKRs) to maintain project visibility and alignment with strategic goals.
<br><br>
I am enthusiastic about the possibility of applying my project leadership skills to Hagerty Consultingâ€™s mission. I am a quick learner, eager to develop expertise in the FEMA Public Assistance Program, and committed to contributing to your firm's reputation for excellence and innovation in emergency management.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my experience can benefit your clients and support their recovery efforts.
