SUBJECT: Application for Systematic Literature Review Project Manager (RA III) at Thermo Fisher Scientific
CONTENT: 
Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my keen interest in the Systematic Literature Review Project Manager position at Thermo Fisher Scientific, as advertised on LinkedIn. My 10+ years of experience in managing complex, data-intensive projects, particularly within the healthcare sector, aligns well with the requirements of this role and your company's mission to serve science.

A recurring challenge in my project work has been the need to translate complex requirements from diverse stakeholders into structured, actionable plans with clear, measurable outcomes.
<br><br>
In a recent project for Banco de Chile, I led the end-to-end implementation of a new data warehouse and Power BI analytics platform. This involved defining the project scope, managing a large cross-functional team, and overseeing the budget and timeline. The action resulted in a fully functional data analytics solution that provided stakeholders with streamlined access to critical business insights, enhancing their strategic decision-making capabilities.
<br><br>
Similarly, when managing the delivery of an AI-powered chatbot for Royal Caribbean, I successfully guided the project from the initial proposal and discovery phase to production release. I coordinated with technical and product teams to synthesize user needs into technical specifications, planned and executed the project within a fixed-price model, and managed all client communications. The result was an on-time delivery that significantly improved guest service efficiency and digital engagement.
<br><br>
The opportunity to apply my adaptive project management discipline, client relations experience, and background in data analysis to the vital field of health services research is incredibly appealing. I am confident that my ability to manage project lifecycles, budgets, and stakeholder communications can bring significant value to Evidera's research initiatives.
