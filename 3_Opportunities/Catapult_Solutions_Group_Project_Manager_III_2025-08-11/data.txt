SUBJECT: Application for Program Manager – ServiceNow HRSD Implementation at Catapult Solutions Group
CONTENT: Dear Austin Garza,<br><br>I am writing to express my keen interest in the Program Manager – ServiceNow HRSD Implementation role. My background in leading complex, enterprise-wide technology transformations, particularly with Salesforce and AI-driven support systems, aligns directly with the requirements of this high-visibility HR initiative.<br><br>In a previous role, a client faced operational inefficiencies due to fragmented legacy systems, hindering their service delivery.

I thrive on bridging the gap between business goals and technical execution and am adept at managing the cross-functional collaboration required for a successful transformation.<br><br>I am eager to bring my adaptive project management approach and experience in HR-adjacent platform implementations to your client, ensuring their organizational needs are met while delivering a cutting-edge HR service model.
