SUBJECT: Application for Senior Project Manager at ASSYST
CONTENT: 
Dear Hiring Manager,<br><br>I am writing to express my strong interest in the Senior Project Manager position at ASSYST, as advertised on LinkedIn. With over 10 years of experience leading complex, enterprise-level projects for both commercial and public sector clients, I am confident in my ability to deliver exceptional results for your state agency client.<br><br>In a recent role, my client, a major financial institution, faced challenges with project alignment and delivery across a globally distributed team of over 100 engineers. I took action by implementing a Scrum of Scrums framework, leading five scrum masters and establishing clear KPI/OKR tracking and executive reporting channels. The result was the successful, on-budget delivery of a critical data center migration and new mobile app features, ensuring full stakeholder alignment.<br><br>I also have direct experience managing projects under government contracts. For the Colombian Police, the problem was the need for a secure, large-scale system to manage sensitive video evidence from over 3,000 bodycams. I led the end-to-end project lifecycle for this integrated hardware and software solution, which functioned as a secure enterprise content management system. This resulted in the successful deployment and operational support for the system across multiple cities, proving my ability to deliver critical solutions under government regulations and on a fixed-price contract.<br><br>I am particularly drawn to ASSYSTâ€™s work supporting public institutions like the Texas Education Agency. My adaptive project management approach, which blends formal planning with Agile execution, is perfectly suited for navigating the unique requirements of public sector projects. My expertise in budget management, contract oversight, and full lifecycle delivery, supported by my SAFe Agilist and Google Project Management certifications, has prepared me to quickly integrate with your team and contribute to your client's success.
