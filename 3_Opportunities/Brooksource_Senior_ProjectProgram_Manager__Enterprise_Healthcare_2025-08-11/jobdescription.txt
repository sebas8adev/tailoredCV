Job Description:
About the job
Job Title: Senior Program Manager (Enterprise Strategic Initiatives – Healthcare)
Job Type: Contract (Eligibility to Convert after 6 Months; Contract Renewed Every 12)
Location: 100% Remote (EST Working Hours; Monday-Friday)
Industry: Healthcare Insurance


Job Overview:
Our client is undergoing a major, high-visibility enterprise program that sits at the center of their strategic roadmaps for Medicaid expansion and acquisition integration. It spans multiple business units and technology domains, and it has direct visibility with the C-suite and board-level stakeholders. The organization needs a senior, hands-on program leader who can quickly impose structure, align executives, and drive outcomes. This role is not about steady-state coordination; it is about rapidly establishing governance, clarifying the plan, protecting the critical path, and converting strategy into measurable results.

You will inherit multiple workstreams, vendor partners, and competing priorities in a fast-paced, matrixed environment. Success requires exceptional executive communication, the judgment to make tradeoffs with imperfect information, and the discipline to manage RAID logs, decision histories, and KPIs. If you thrive on leading large-scale programs, facilitating executive decisions, and delivering readiness across people, process, and technology, this role will give you the scope and urgency you’re looking for.


What You’ll Do:
Own program delivery for large, enterprise-scale initiatives from charter through benefits realization, managing scope, schedule, budget, quality, risks, and dependencies.
Run executive-level forums (steerco, operating reviews) including agenda design, briefing materials, decision logs, and follow-through on actions.
Translate strategy to execution by defining OKRs/KPIs, roadmaps, milestones, and critical paths; ensure alignment across product, clinical, operations, IT, compliance, and finance.
Navigate a matrixed environment to align senior stakeholders, resolve conflicts, and remove blockers; influence without direct authority.
Establish governance and cadence (RAID management, change control, release plans) and enforce operating rhythms across multiple workstreams and vendor partners.
Drive clarity and communication with crisp status reporting, exec-ready narratives, and data-driven insights that enable timely decisions.
Uplift delivery practices by standardizing templates, playbooks, and dashboards; mentor project managers and workstream leads.
Ensure readiness across people, process, tech, and policy for major launches; coordinate cutover, training, and adoption plans.


What You’ll Bring:
8+ years of progressive program/project leadership experience, including 5+ years leading large-scale, cross-functional enterprise programs; healthcare exposure strongly preferred.
Demonstrated success running executive meetings and communicating with C-suite and senior leadership (concise storytelling, decision framing, risk tradeoffs).
Proven ability to operate in fast-paced, complex, matrixed organizations with multiple vendors and competing priorities.
Expertise in strategy execution: road mapping, benefits realization, KPI/OKR design, dependency management, and change management.
Tools proficiency (required):
Excel (pivot tables, advanced formulas, data modeling for status/forecasting preferred)
Expertise in Microsoft 365 (Outlook/Teams/Words) and SharePoint (structured repositories, versioning, permissions, automated workflows)
Jira for requirements tracking (program-level boards, epics, workflows, reporting; alignment with SDLC/Agile at scale)


Nice to Have:
Experience with government health programs (Medicare/Medicaid/D-SNP) is a major nice-to-have.
M&A program leadership (integration/separation management, Day 1/Day 2 planning, operating model, systems/process harmonization) is preferred.
Certifications: PMP is preferred but not required.
