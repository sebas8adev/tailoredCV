About the Role
We are seeking an experienced Transmission and Interconnection Project Manager to lead and support interconnection and transmission activities for large-scale renewable energy projects, with a strong focus on LGIA implementation during the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) phase.
The ideal candidate will have a proven track record in interconnection studies and transmission project execution from either Independent Power Producers (IPPs) or utilities (e.g., PacificCorp, Bonneville Power Administration, Puget Sound Energy, Portland General Electric, etc.). This role is crucial to supporting projects in the Western U.S. (WECC) region.

Key Responsibilities
Lead and manage all stages of the interconnection process from application to LGIA execution for utility-scale renewable projects.
Prepare and submit interconnection applications, study agreements, and related documentation while tracking deposits and meeting regulatory deadlines.
Monitor interconnection study milestones, deliverables, and LGIA compliance.
Identify and mitigate study delays using a strong understanding of OATTs and LGIP frameworks.
Collaborate with internal EPC, engineering, and development teams to meet transmission owner technical requirements.
Review and interpret interconnection studies, LGIAs, and transmission plans to guide internal teams.
Engage regularly with utilities, ISOs/RTOs, and industry groups to stay informed on transmission policies and market trends.
Track long-term transmission expansion plans, IRPs, and queue dynamics to inform early-stage project siting.
Conduct data-driven analysis, including queue attrition studies, LMP trends, load growth forecasts, and GIS-based mapping.
Support project financial tracking, invoice management, and audits.
Required Qualifications
5+ years in renewable energy transmission/interconnection project management.
Strong WECC experience and knowledge of interconnection procedures (LGIP, LGIA, transmission planning).
Experience with substation engineering, transmission design, and post-development/EPC interconnection work.
Prior work with or for utilities like BPA, PacificCorp, Portland General Electric, or Puget Sound Energy preferred.
Familiarity with EPC design issues such as protection relays, substation construction, and proactive relay installations.
Ability to interpret and explain LGIAs, transmission studies, and interconnection agreements.
Proficiency in Excel, GIS tools, and energy market data analysis.
Strong communication, problem-solving, and organizational skills.
Comfortable working remotely in a fast-paced environment.
Preferred Qualifications
Engineering degree or technical background in power systems or energy infrastructure.
Knowledge of transmission modeling tools (PSS¬ÆE, PowerWorld, EMS).
Understanding of evolving transmission policy, queue reform, and regulatory engagement.
