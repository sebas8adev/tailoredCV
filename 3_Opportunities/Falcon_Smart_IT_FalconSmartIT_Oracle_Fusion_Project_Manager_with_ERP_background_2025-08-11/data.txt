SUBJECT: Application for Oracle Fusion Project Manager at Falcon Smart IT
CONTENT: 
Dear Harinii Suriyakumar,
<br><br>
I am writing to express my strong interest in the Oracle Fusion Project Manager position at Falcon Smart IT, which I discovered on LinkedIn. With over 10 years of experience leading complex, full-cycle system implementations and digital transformations for global enterprises, I am confident that my background in managing large-scale projects aligns perfectly with the requirements of this role.
<br><br>
In a previous role, I addressed the challenge of a major financial institution, Banco de Chile, needing to overhaul its core data infrastructure. I led a program to migrate their datacenter to GCP and implement a new data warehouse, managing a cross-functional team of over 100 engineers. By implementing a hybrid Scrum methodology and rigorous KPI tracking, we successfully delivered the complex platform on schedule, ensuring business continuity and enhancing data capabilities.
<br><br>
My experience extends directly to ERP implementation. As IT Manager at Bodytech, I was the technical leader for the company-wide Microsoft Dynamics CRM & ERP implementation across more than 60 sites in three countries. I managed the entire project lifecycle, from planning and vendor management to cutover and post-production support. This initiative successfully unified business operations, centralized financial data, and provided a scalable platform for future growth.
<br><br>
While my direct experience is with systems like Dynamics and Salesforce, my core expertise lies in the platform-agnostic principles of ERP project management: developing project plans, managing budgets, coordinating with stakeholders to define scope, leading data migration and integration efforts, and mitigating risks to ensure on-time, high-quality delivery. I am adept at leading the cross-functional teams required to make any ERP implementation, including Oracle Fusion, a success.
<br><br>
I am eager to bring my adaptive project management approach and experience in large-scale system delivery to your team. Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to discussing how my skills can contribute to your projects.
