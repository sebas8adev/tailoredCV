SUBJECT: Application for Senior Project Manager Q2R at The Planet Group
CONTENT: 
Dear Mike Griffin,<br><br>I am writing to express my strong interest in the Senior Project Manager Q2R position advertised on LinkedIn. My background in leading complex system implementations, particularly in SaaS, e-commerce, and financial services, aligns perfectly with the requirements of this high-profile revenue recognition project.<br><br>I understand your client faces the critical challenge of outgrowing their SF CPQ and needing a new, scalable system to manage dynamic pricing, subscriptions, and revenue recognition across acquired business units. In my career, I have repeatedly tackled similar challenges. For example, at IT Big Boss, I led the development of a SaaS POS platform with complex billing, invoicing, and payment processing logic for over 1,000 businesses. This involved architecting the entire revenue lifecycle, from sales transaction to financial reporting, establishing a successful recurring revenue model.<br><br>Subsequently, at Globant, I directed e-commerce enhancements for Dick's Sporting Goods, focusing on checkout and pricing features which improved platform performance by 40%. I also have direct experience with large-scale CRM implementations, including Salesforce and Microsoft Dynamics, which gives me a deep understanding of the processes your client is migrating from. My expertise in collaborating with sales and marketing teams on pricing and packaging, coupled with my ability to guide C-level stakeholders through strategic decisions, has been central to my success. My knowledge of AI is also a valuable asset for process optimization.<br><br>I am confident in my ability to manage the full journey of this implementation, from collaborating with systems integrators to applying revenue recognition best practices. I am eager to bring my adaptive project management approach and systems expertise to help your client build a robust and future-proof revenue system.
