Dear KellyMitchell Group Hiring Team,<br/><br/>I am writing to express my keen interest in the Project Manager, Digital and Marketing Delivery position I found on LinkedIn. My experience in leading the end-to-end delivery of complex, consumer-facing digital projects for global brands in the travel, retail, and finance sectors aligns perfectly with the requirements of this role.<br/><br/>In my role at Globant, I successfully managed the delivery of guest-facing platforms for Royal Caribbean, including mobile applications and AI-driven solutions. This involved leading multiple globally distributed teams, managing project budgets exceeding $5M, and ensuring adherence to the full Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) from inception through launch.

I have a strong track record of delivering both mobile (iOS/Android) and web-based platforms, managing project scope, timelines, and risks while providing clear, concise status reports to executive-level stakeholders.<br/><br/>With certifications including SAFe 6 Agilist, Advanced Certified ScrumMaster (A-CSM), and specializations in Google Cloud and Generative AI, I am confident in my ability to contribute significant value to your client. Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to discussing how my skills and experience can support your client's objectives.
