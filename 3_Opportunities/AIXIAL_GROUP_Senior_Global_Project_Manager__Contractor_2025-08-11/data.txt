SUBJECT: Application for Senior Global Project Manager at AIXIAL GROUP
CONTENT: 
Dear Neringa Kovalenkovaitė,
<br><br>
I am writing to express my strong interest in the Senior Global Project Manager position at AIXIAL GROUP, which I discovered on LinkedIn. With over a decade of experience managing complex, global projects in highly regulated industries, including healthcare, I am confident that my skills in financial management, cross-functional leadership, and full-cycle project execution align perfectly with the requirements of this role.
<br><br>
In my previous roles, I faced the challenge of delivering large-scale digital programs across multiple continents with strict budget and timeline constraints. To address this, I implemented a robust project management framework combining SAFe and Scrum methodologies to lead globally distributed teams of over 100 professionals. This action resulted in the successful delivery of multi-million dollar project portfolios and a 40% improvement in platform performance for a major retail client by optimizing resource allocation and quarterly planning.
<br><br>
Furthermore, my background includes directing projects that require absolute data integrity and adherence to strict protocols, which is critical in a clinical setting. I have led the development of healthcare IT solutions, including clinical history systems and medical imaging integrations (HL7/DICOM), ensuring patient data was managed securely. This experience, combined with my proficiency in managing RFP responses and bid defenses, has equipped me with the skills to oversee complex clinical studies, manage vendors, and ensure client satisfaction while upholding the highest standards of quality and safety.
<br><br>
The opportunity to contribute to a leading Contract Research Organization like AIXIAL GROUP is particularly exciting. I am passionate about leveraging technology and rigorous project management to support the advancement of clinical trials. My adaptive approach and commitment to excellence would allow me to make a significant contribution to your dynamic and supportive team.
<br><br>
Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my resume for your review and welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience can benefit AIXIAL GROUP.
