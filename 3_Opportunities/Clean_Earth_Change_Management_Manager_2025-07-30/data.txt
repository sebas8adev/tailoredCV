SUBJECT: Application for Change Management Manager at Clean Earth
CONTENT: 
Dear Sarina M. Simpson,

<br><br>I am writing to express my strong interest in the Change Management Manager position at Clean Earth, as advertised on LinkedIn. With over 10 years of experience leading complex technology and process transformations, I have developed a deep expertise in the core principles of Organizational Change Management (OCM) by guiding organizations through significant operational shifts.

<br><br>Throughout my career, I have been responsible for implementing new methodologies like SAFe and Scrum across large, globally distributed teams. This work was fundamentally about managing change: I developed comprehensive strategies to drive adoption, created communication plans to ensure stakeholder buy-in from engineers to C-level executives, and coached teams to minimize resistance and embrace new ways of working. My experience directly aligns with the responsibilities of developing change plans, conducting impact and stakeholder analyses, and ensuring successful transitions.

<br><br>For example, at Globant, I led the Agile transformation for clients like Royal Caribbean and Dickâ€™s Sporting Goods. This involved creating and executing training programs, establishing new communication cadences, and continuously monitoring metrics (KPIs/OKRs) to measure the effectiveness of the change and ensure it delivered on business objectives. I am adept at working in high-pressure environments, navigating ambiguity, and integrating with diverse business units to achieve unified goals.

<br><br>My background in project management has equipped me with a structured, adaptive approach to facilitating smooth transformations and optimizing organizational effectiveness. I am confident that my practical experience in leading successful change initiatives makes me an excellent candidate for this role.

<br><br>Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the possibility of discussing my qualifications further.

<br><br>Sincerely,

<br><br>Your Name
