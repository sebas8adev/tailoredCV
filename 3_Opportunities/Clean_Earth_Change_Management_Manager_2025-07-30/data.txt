SUBJECT: Application for Change Management Manager at Clean Earth
CONTENT: Dear Sarina M. Simpson,
<br><br>
I am writing to express my keen interest in the Change Management Manager position at Clean Earth, as advertised on LinkedIn. With over 10 years of experience leading complex organizational transformations and technology adoption initiatives, I have developed a robust skill set in executing the very principles of Organizational Change Management (OCM) your role requires.
<br><br>
Throughout my career, I have successfully planned and implemented new methodologies like SAFe and Scrum across large, globally distributed teams of over 100 professionals. This involved creating comprehensive change strategies, conducting stakeholder analysis, developing targeted communication plans, and designing training programs to ensure smooth transitions and drive user adoption. For instance, at Globant, I led the implementation of new agile frameworks for clients like Banco de Chile, which required coaching teams, facilitating workshops, and managing resistance to foster a culture of continuous improvement.
<br><br>
My background as a Technical Project Manager aligns directly with the preferred qualifications for this role. I am an expert in creating clear communication materials, from C-level RAG status reports to user-facing guides, and am highly skilled in stakeholder engagement to build consensus and manage expectations. I thrive in dynamic environments, using my analytical abilities to mitigate risks and measure the effectiveness of change initiatives through KPIs and OKRs.
<br><br>
My adaptive approach and hands-on experience in guiding teams through significant operational and technological shifts have consistently resulted in enhanced efficiency, improved collaboration, and successful project delivery. I am confident that my leadership qualities and practical expertise in change management would make me a valuable asset to your team.
<br><br>
Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to discuss how my experience can help Clean Earth achieve its strategic objectives.
