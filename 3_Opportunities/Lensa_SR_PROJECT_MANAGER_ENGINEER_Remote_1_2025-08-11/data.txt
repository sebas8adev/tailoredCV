SUBJECT: Application for SR PROJECT MANAGER ENGINEER (Remote) 1 at TE Connectivity
CONTENT: 
Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the SR PROJECT MANAGER ENGINEER position at TE Connectivity, as advertised on LinkedIn. Your mission to create a safer, sustainable, and more connected world through industrial technology deeply resonates with my professional passion for leveraging technology to solve complex challenges. My background as an adaptive Project Manager with a degree in Systems Engineering aligns perfectly with the requirements of this role.
<br><br>
In my career, I have consistently managed the end-to-end delivery of complex technology products. A significant challenge in product development is navigating the lifecycle from concept to market launch while adhering to strict budget and quality controls. I addressed this by leading cross-functional, multicultural teams through structured, gated project methodologies, similar to the Toll-Gate process. For instance, I managed the full lifecycle of a bodycam system, an integrated hardware-software product, resulting in the successful deployment of over 3,000 units for a government client, meeting all contractual obligations.
<br><br>
Another critical aspect of project management is ensuring financial viability and maintaining stakeholder alignment. I have managed project capital and expenditures by developing detailed budget forecasts, performing cost-benefit analysis for RFPs, and establishing clear communication cadences with C-level stakeholders. At Dick's Sporting Goods, my leadership in resource planning and progress tracking against financial metrics directly contributed to a 40% improvement in e-commerce platform performance, demonstrating my ability to deliver results that meet key business objectives like ROI and cost-efficiency.
<br><br>
My experience in leading diverse teams, managing project financials, and executing complex product development initiatives, combined with my PMP-equivalent certifications (SAFe, A-CSM) and engineering background, makes me confident that I possess the skills and drive to excel at TE Connectivity. I am eager to contribute my results-driven approach to your team.
