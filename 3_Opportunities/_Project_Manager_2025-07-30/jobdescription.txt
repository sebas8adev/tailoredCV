Program Manager – Clinical Development
Reports to: Chief Medical Officer
Position Summary
An emerging clinical-stage biotechnology company is seeking a Program Manager to help drive key initiatives across its drug development portfolio. The Program Manager will serve as the operational hub for cross-functional teams, ensuring that program timelines, deliverables, and budgets stay on track while supporting strategic execution for high-impact therapeutic programs.
This role offers the opportunity to work closely with senior leadership and collaborate with internal stakeholders, CROs, vendors, and academic partners in a fast-paced, early-stage biotech environment.
Key Responsibilities
Develop and maintain cross-functional program plans — including timelines, milestones, budgets, and risk registers — leveraging project management tools (e.g., Smartsheet, Gantt charts).
Coordinate across internal functions (Clinical, Regulatory, CMC, Research, Operations) and external partners (CROs, vendors, academic collaborators) to drive program progress.
Manage multiple projects simultaneously across diverse disciplines, including clinical and non-clinical development, CMC, alliances, and operational initiatives.
Track program performance and anticipate issues, driving proactive solutions to keep programs on schedule and within scope.
Support strategic planning and preparation for leadership updates, partner meetings, conferences, and investor presentations.
Assist with execution of high-priority projects that are critical to advancing the company’s pipeline.
Qualifications & Education
Bachelor’s degree required; advanced scientific degree preferred.
3–5+ years of relevant program or project management experience in biotech, pharma, CRO, or research settings.
PMP certification a plus but not required.
Proficiency in Microsoft Office and project management software (e.g., Smartsheet).
Demonstrated ability to juggle multiple timelines and priorities effectively.
Some travel may be required.
Hybrid or in-office work preferred (currently remote-flexible).
Personal Characteristics & Cultural Fit
Thrives in a dynamic, entrepreneurial environment and enjoys rolling up their sleeves to make things happen.
Self-starter with initiative, independence, and a drive to meaningfully contribute.
Collaborative and solution-oriented with strong problem-solving instincts.
Creative and adaptable — able to pivot when priorities shift.
Values teamwork, transparency, and cross-functional partnership.
Exceptional communication skills — interpersonal, written, and verbal.
Highly organized with a strong sense of urgency and accountability.
About the Company
This small but ambitious biotech is focused on innovative therapies for serious unmet needs in gastrointestinal and inflammatory diseases. The team is passionate, collaborative, and mission-driven — the kind of environment where contributions are highly visible and impact is immediate.
