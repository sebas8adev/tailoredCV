SUBJECT: Application for IT Project Manager at Luxoft
CONTENT: Dear Elizabeth Chavez,<br><br>I am writing to express my strong interest in the IT Project Manager position at Luxoft, as advertised on LinkedIn. With over 10 years of experience leading large-scale technical projects and directing cross-functional teams, I am confident that my expertise in infrastructure modernization and complex project delivery aligns perfectly with the requirements of this role.<br><br>In a recent role, I addressed the challenge of an outdated and costly on-premise infrastructure for a major financial client, Banco de Chile. I led a program to migrate their entire datacenter to Google Cloud Platform, directing a team of over 100 engineers. My actions involved defining the migration strategy, managing the project schedule, mitigating risks, and overseeing the budget. The result was a successful modernization of their core infrastructure, leading to enhanced system performance and significant operational cost reductions.<br><br>At Royal Caribbean, I was responsible for delivering new features for the guest-facing mobile application under a fixed-price contract, which required meticulous budget and scope control. I directed cross-functional teams using SAFe, managed the full project lifecycle, and implemented a robust release management process. This resulted in the on-time, on-budget delivery of key digital services, including an AI-powered chatbot and onboard room service, directly enhancing the guest experience and satisfaction.<br><br>I am particularly drawn to Luxoft's position as a leader in providing high-end technology solutions. My background in consulting, combined with a deep technical proficiency and an adaptive approach to project management, has prepared me to translate complex concepts into actionable strategies and drive successful outcomes for clients. I am eager to bring my skills in infrastructure projects, team leadership, and budget management to your team.<br><br>Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how I can contribute to Luxoft's continued success.
