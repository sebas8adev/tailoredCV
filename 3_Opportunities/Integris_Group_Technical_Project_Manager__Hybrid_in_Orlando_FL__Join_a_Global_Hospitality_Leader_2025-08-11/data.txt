SUBJECT: Application for Technical Project Manager at Integris Group
CONTENT: 
Dear Hiring Manager,
<br><br>
I am writing to express my keen interest in the Technical Project Manager role for your global hospitality client, as advertised on LinkedIn. With over 10 years of experience leading complex technical projects, including cloud migrations and security initiatives for global brands like Royal Caribbean, I am confident I possess the skills and expertise necessary to drive your client's key projects to success.
<br><br>
I understand your client is focused on a significant Cloud Migration and critical Security & Compliance projects. In a previous role, I addressed a similar challenge by leading the migration of a major banking datacenter to Google Cloud. My action was to structure and direct a program involving 100+ cross-functional personnel, implementing SAFe and Scrum to manage the complex roadmap. The result was the successful, on-time execution of the migration, meeting all quarterly KPIs and delivering a modernized, scalable infrastructure.
<br><br>
The role also requires a leader who can manage budgets, timelines, and cross-functional teams within an Agile framework. While managing the digital product portfolio for Royal Caribbean, I was responsible for the full project lifecycle, from budgeting and resource allocation to release management. I facilitated Scrum ceremonies and maintained a prioritized backlog, resulting in the successful launch of new features for the Guest App and Digital Concierge, directly enhancing the onboard guest experience and ensuring alignment with business goals.
<br><br>
My experience in the hospitality sector, combined with my technical background in cloud infrastructure and security, aligns perfectly with the needs of your client. I am passionate about leveraging technology to create seamless customer experiences and am excited by the opportunity to contribute to a leader in the hospitality industry. I am eager to bring my adaptive project management approach to your team.
<br><br>
Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how my experience can benefit your client.
