Job Description:
About the job
Tishman is seeking an experienced Project Manager to oversee capital projects at the WDW Swan, Dolphin, and Reserve Complex. This full-time, Orlando-based role offers the opportunity to manage a continuous pipeline of diverse, high-visibility projects: renovations, updates and replacements, from concept through completion.

The ideal candidate brings strong project execution skills, enjoys navigating all phases of design and construction, and is comfortable driving results in a fast-paced, team-oriented environment. This role is best suited for someone who enjoys being deeply involved in the full life cycle of capital work—without the expectation of broader leadership tracks.

Key Areas of Responsibility
Oversee consultants (designers, engineers, architects, purchasing agents) and liaise with hotel engineering to ensure on-site work aligns with design specs, codes, and contracts
Lead planning, budgeting, and scheduling for renovations, additions, and upgrades
Manage the design process, including plan reviews, value engineering, and energy/cost efficiency analyses
Draft and negotiate contracts, including scope development and approval documentation
Review and manage FF&E shop drawings, POs, inventory, warehousing, installation, punch lists, and quality standards
Drive full project execution—from scope and RFP development through contractor selection, procurement, budget tracking, invoice approvals, commissioning, and closeout

Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities
Proven ability to lead capital projects from planning through closeout, on time and within budget
Strong background in construction oversight and design coordination, ideally within hospitality or similar commercial environments
Skilled in project scheduling, budgeting, and contract negotiation
Comfortable managing multiple priorities in a fast-paced, team-oriented setting
Confident communicator with experience coordinating across internal stakeholders and external vendors
Ability to read construction documents and contract directly with general contractors
Highly organized with excellent attention to detail, follow-through, and problem-solving skills
Proficient in Microsoft Office (Excel, Word, Project) and video conferencing tools
Self-directed with a high degree of independence and accountability

Work Experience Requirements
7–10 years of progressive experience in project management, ideally transitioning from field execution to owner’s rep or developer-side roles
Experience delivering renovation and infrastructure projects in hospitality (preferred), timeshare, healthcare, or other commercial environments
Demonstrated success managing full-cycle capital projects, vendor coordination, and FF&E

Education Requirements
Bachelor’s degree in Construction Management, Architecture, Engineering, or a related field
