SUBJECT: Application for Utility Incentive Project Manager at Rangam
CONTENT: 
Dear Megha Barot,
<br><br>
I am writing to express my keen interest in the Utility Incentive Project Manager position with Rangam, as advertised on LinkedIn. My background in leading complex retail and partner-focused programs, combined with mandatory experience in Salesforce, aligns perfectly with the requirements for the IRA Retail Point-of-Sale rebate program. I am excited by the opportunity to contribute to a significant clean energy initiative with a direct impact on consumers and retailers.
<br><br>
In a recent role, I faced the challenge of managing a large, distributed network of authorized dealers for a client, which required a robust system for onboarding, sales tracking, and engagement. I led the end-to-end implementation of a Salesforce CRM platform, defining the project scope, managing stakeholder communications, and overseeing the development of custom workflows. This action resulted in a unified system that streamlined partner management, improved data reporting capabilities, and provided a scalable foundation for program growth.
<br><br>
Similarly, when tasked with improving the performance of a major retail e-commerce platform for Dick's Sporting Goods, I managed a program focused on data-driven optimizations. By analyzing key metrics and leading cross-functional teams, we executed a strategic roadmap that resulted in a 40% improvement in platform performance, directly enhancing the customer experience and supporting sales objectives.
<br><br>
While my direct experience is in retail and technology program management, the core responsibilities—managing partner enrollment, tracking transactional data, ensuring compliance, and owning program operations—are skills I have honed over a decade. I am confident in my ability to quickly adapt my expertise to the specifics of utility rebate programs and contribute to the successful rollout and expansion of this important initiative.
<br><br>
Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to discuss how my project management skills, retail engagement experience, and data analysis capabilities can benefit your client's program.
