# Cover Letter Content
SUBJECT: Application for Associate Director, CMC Project Management at WuXi AppTec
CONTENT: Dear Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Associate Director, CMC Project Management position at WuXi AppTec, which I discovered on LinkedIn. With over 10 years of experience managing the complete lifecycle of complex, technical projects for external clients in a contract-based environment, I am confident I possess the rigorous project management discipline and client-facing skills required for this role.
<br><br>
My background involves leading projects from the proposal and planning stages through to execution, monitoring, and completion, closely mirroring the responsibilities outlined in your job description. I have a history of serving as the primary liaison between clients, technical teams, and business development, ensuring project objectives, timelines, and budgets are met. My experience at Globant, a technology consulting firm, is analogous to the CRO/CMO model, where I was responsible for delivering solutions for clients in highly regulated industries like finance and healthcare.
<br><br>
While my domain expertise has been in technology, I have consistently demonstrated an ability to quickly master new, complex industries and their unique technical and regulatory challenges. For instance, I have successfully delivered healthcare projects involving regulated data standards like DICOM and HL7. I am a self-motivated, adaptive leader adept at managing cross-functional teams and implementing corrective measures to navigate project challenges.
<br><br>
I am eager to apply my extensive project management skills and problem-solving abilities to the pharmaceutical sector at WuXi AppTec. Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to discussing how my experience can benefit your team.
<br><br>
Sincerely,
[Your Name]
