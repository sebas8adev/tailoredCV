SUBJECT: Application for Integration Project Manager - AI Ultrasound at GE Healthcare
CONTENT: 
Dear Hiring Manager,
<br><br>
I am writing to express my keen interest in the Integration Project Manager - AI Ultrasound position at GE Healthcare, as advertised on LinkedIn. Your mission to improve clinical outcomes through AI-driven digital solutions resonates deeply with my professional experience in leading complex technology integrations within the healthcare sector. My background in managing projects that bridge the gap between medical devices, software, and AI is directly aligned with the requirements of this role.
<br><br>
In a recent role, my team faced the challenge of integrating disparate medical imaging data for several hospital clients to enable centralized visualization and analysis. I took action by leading the project to transfer medical device data, using the DICOM standard, to a unified AWS cloud platform. This involved coordinating with clinical staff to understand workflows and with engineering teams to build a compliant and efficient data pipeline. The result was a seamless, integrated system that improved diagnostic image accessibility for physicians and established a foundation for future AI-driven analytical tools.
<br><br>
I also have extensive experience aligning multi-team execution with strategic business goals. At Globant, I was responsible for delivering a portfolio of digital products for Royal Caribbean, which required integrating AI features like a guest-facing chatbot. I acted as the central point of contact, managing dependencies across three globally distributed teams and translating technical progress into clear KPIs for C-level stakeholders. This leadership ensured the on-time, on-budget delivery of integrated solutions that significantly enhanced the customer experience and operational efficiency.
<br><br>
My 10+ years of technical project management experience, combined with a Bachelor's degree in Systems Engineering and hands-on work with clinical workflows and healthcare data standards (HL7 V2, DICOM), has prepared me to meet the challenges of this role. I am confident I can successfully drive the integration of your AI solutions into the broader ultrasound ecosystem.
<br><br>
Thank you for your time and consideration. I am eager to discuss how my skills in project execution, cross-functional leadership, and AI integration can contribute to the innovative work at GE Healthcare.
