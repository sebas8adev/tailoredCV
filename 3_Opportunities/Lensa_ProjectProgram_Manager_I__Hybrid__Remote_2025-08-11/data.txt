SUBJECT: Application for Project/Program Manager I at Shuvel Digital
CONTENT: 
Dear Hiring Manager,
<br><br>
I am writing to express my strong interest in the Project/Program Manager I position, as advertised on LinkedIn. With over 10 years of experience leading complex, enterprise-wide technology implementations, I am confident that my skills in strategic planning, cross-functional coordination, and change management align perfectly with the requirements of this role, particularly the initiative to implement a new candidate selection assessment system.
<br><br>
In a previous role, I faced the challenge of aligning over 100 stakeholders across business, technology, and leadership for a major digital transformation at Banco de Chile. I took action by implementing a Scrum of Scrums framework and leading a critical staffing initiative to define requirements, interview, and onboard over 150 new team members. The result was a fully staffed program that successfully met its strategic objectives, with clear alignment and communication across all organizational levels.
<br><br>
Successfully launching new technology requires robust project management and a focus on user adoption. At Royal Caribbean, I was responsible for the end-to-end delivery of new digital guest applications. I developed comprehensive project plans, managed budgets, mitigated risks, and established a hyper-care support model to ensure a smooth transition. This resulted in a seamless product launch with high user adoption, delivered on time and within scope.
<br><br>
My expertise in planning, scheduling, budgeting, risk management, and process improvement has been central to my career. I am particularly drawn to this opportunity because it combines technology implementation with strategic HR, a domain where I have direct experience. I am eager to bring my adaptive project management approach to Shuvel Digital and contribute to the successful adoption of your new assessment tools.
