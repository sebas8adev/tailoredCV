Second, review the attached jobdescription.txt file.
Finally, help me with:
1. Help me tailor my CV to that Job Description:
- Generate a new Career Summary, taking into account the job description, recruiter message, and my experience with the valuable transferible experience.
NOTE 1: The structure should be something like, no more than 3 lines: [General Role] professional with [number] years of experience in [areas or activities of specialization or industry]. (Passionate about [mission]) OR (Key quantifiable metric to give a sense of scale of past responsibility). 
NOTE 2: check the one that I have on LinkedIn:
"Dynamic and results-oriented Senior Technical Project Manager with a robust track record leading complex, end-to-end projects across diverse business markets including Finance, Healthcare, Retail, Travel/Hospitality, Media, and Public Safety. My expertise in project management approaches encompasses Agile methodologies (SAFe, Scrum, Kanban) and a deep understanding of formal PMP/PMI project management practices, enabling me to effectively steer globally distributed, cross-functional teams (+30-100 engineers) towards exceeding project goals.
I am proficient in managing various types of projects, including cloud infrastructure initiatives (AWS, GCP, Azure), multifaceted system integrations, full SDLC software development, and delivering AI-driven solutions such as chatbots and Generative AI applications. My experience covers the full project lifecycle, from strategic planning, RFP response, and meticulous execution to risk management, budget oversight, and seamless release management.
With a strong technical foundation that includes technologies such as cloud platforms, API development/utilization, data migration, and AI integration, I excel at translating complex requirements into actionable plans and fostering clear stakeholder communication.
Certified in SAFe (SAFe 6 Agilist), Scrum (A-CSM, CSM, CSPO), Google Cloud (Digital Leader), AWS (Cloud Technical Essentials), and Generative AI (Microsoft and LinkedIn), I am passionate about driving innovation and operational efficiency. My focus is on leveraging my extensive experience to contribute to impactful projects and foster organizational success.
I welcome connections with industry professionals to discuss advancements and potential collaborations."
Try to have a more robust career summary, according to the instructions, the job description, and my current LinkedIn summary.
NOTE 3: Review and adapt it, taking into account this comment: Make sure you add years of experience. It should be more concise, though, to quickly show what kind of professional you are to recruiters 
scanning your resume. Something similar to: Versatile Project Manager with # years of experience leading global teams and delivering complex digital transformations across industries. Skilled in AI-driven, cloud-based, and system integration solutions, with a track record of improving performance and managing large-scale staffing. Expert in Agile (SAFe, Scrum, Kanban) and traditional methodologies, with strengths in end-to-end project delivery, executive reporting, and financial oversight.
NOTE 4: Review and adapt it, taking into account this comment: I suggest using a stronger word than "proficient" since you're trying to convince employers and recruiters you're a strong candidate. Maybe "Expert in"? Additionally, don't include any full sentences. Phrases only.
- Generate a summary of qualifications/ skills aligned with the job description and valuable transferable skills.
NOTE 1: Every skill should not have more than one line of description.
NOTE 2: Group the skills in no more than 4 items, with a single description each.
NOTE 3: Review and adapt it, taking into account these comments: Key skills should be words or very short phrases that reflect hard/technical skills (no soft skills like communication). For example, “Stakeholder Engagement” instead of “Working with stakeholders to…”. Employers are scanning your resume very quickly to identify your key skills, so you want to give them the information they need as directly and concisely as possible. You should definitely have categories if they’re relevant (e.g., “Project Management Methodologies: Scrum, Waterfall,...”), but all of the items listed in those categories should also be words or very short phrases. 
NOTE 4: Just include the relevant skills directly related to the Job Description, or, if some of my key skills are not direct on the Job Description, include them if those skills are directly transferible to the role.
These categories are likely easier to scan and identify your top skills, the following is just an example, don't do it exactly, generate them according to the job description and my job experience:

ADDITIONAL NOTES:
- Be sure to make it optimal for ATS.
- Be focused on results, achievements, and improvements. Just like any modern hiring manager would like it.
- Include AI in everything that can make sense.
- Keep it short and sweet.
- Try to focus first on the skills needed for the job description and then include the transferable skills from my previous experience.
- Include the markets where I have business acumen.
- Include the known platforms and technologies where I have business acumen.
- Please, when referring to the "years of experience" part, make sure of: Make it 10+ years of experience, or the required number for the job description if it's higher. Make sure to try to avoid age bias.
- Please keep the work history within 3 bullet points per experience.
- Analyze the type of language that the Hiring Manager is using, and the company, and tailor the messages and my CV on the same type of communication.
- Use "adaptive" in my type of approach.
- Avoid complicated words.
- Don't use: proven.
- Avoid mentioning "big clients" or "big projects" to give room to small companies and startups as well as big companies, but more specific to the job description and type of client, and you can use the client name, to give context, such as "Dick's Sporting Goods", "Royal Caribbean", etc.
- Make the work experiences concise for easier scanning. For example, Drove program performance and cost efficiency across client portfolios, including Dick's Sporting Goods, achieving a 40% boost in digital platform efficiency via adaptive quarterly roadmaps and PI Planning.
- Quantify: something like adoption results, e.g., number of users, time to launch, reduction in support issues.
- To make it more concise, remove the examples; they aren't that important for showing your skills.
- Make sure of the Quantify impact—how many users? Did it reduce time spent on documentation?.
- Suggestion to strengthen result: Add benefit—did it reduce patient wait times, improve communication speed?.
- Result is missing. Suggestion: Include outcome—on-time delivery under regulation? Cost savings? Improved compliance?.
- Result missing: automated billing, increased member retention, reduced data entry time?.
- Quantify if possible: ticket resolution rate, satisfaction score, or system uptime?.
- Please double-check the generated text, to be sure of: It's according to the Job Description, Role, Responsibilities, Company, and the specific application. It's according to my specific profile, experience, and skills. The examples, comments, and notes provided are just references; make sure to avoid referenced text or words that don't apply to the company, job description, role, or my experience.
- Don't bias the generated text to specific tasks or responsibilities, such as staffing. Even though it's a big part of the job, it's part of something bigger, like "leadership for high-performance teams", or "team allocation".
- For the cover letter content "CONTENT", include the HTML tags for the new line, and break like, so the final HTML output can show a line between every section.
- The cover letter content "CONTENT" should be more similar to the CV than an actual answer to their specific direct message questions. So, be sure to include the relevant information about my profile, skills, and experience related to the job description, company, and role.
- For the cover letter greetings, such as "Dear Garry", be sure to include the full name: Dear Garry Lastname.
- The "APPLICATION_DATE" should be a grammatically written date in the US, using, for instance, July 2nd, 2025, or so.
- If you identify that the contact is not direct for the job opportunity company, I.E., there is a freelancer recruiter finding candidates for a Universal Studios job position, make sure that the letter is well directed.
- be sure to have a final text clean, avoid [cite_start], [cite: 6, 7], [cite: 9], [cite: 10]

EXPECTED OUTPUT:
I have a formatted text file, with some specific fields by line as follows. Please identify every subtitle, generate the content next to it, and return to me the same specific format with the content updated.
